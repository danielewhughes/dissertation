now ive heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you dont really care for music do you
it goes like this
the fourth the fifth
the minor fall the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah

hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you
to a kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah

hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

baby i have been here before
i know this room ive walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
ive seen your flag
on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
its a cold and its a broken hallelujah

hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

there was a time you let me know
whats really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
i remember when
i moved in you
the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah

hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

maybe theres a god above
but all i ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and its not a cry
you can hear at night
its not somebody whos seen the light
its a cold and its a broken hallelujah

hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

you say i took the name in vain
i dont even know the name
but if i did well really whats it to you
theres a blaze of light
in every word
it doesnt matter which you heard
the holy or the broken hallelujah

hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

i did my best it wasnt much
i couldnt feel so i tried to touch
ive told the truth i didnt come to fool you
and even though
it all went wrong
ill stand before the lord of song
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

how does a bastard orphan son of a whore
and a scotsman dropped in the middle of a
forgotten spot in the caribbean by providence
impoverished in squalor
grow up to be a hero and a scholar

the tendollar founding father without a father
got a lot farther by working a lot harder
by being a lot smarter
by being a selfstarter
by fourteen they placed him in charge of a
trading charter

and every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
away across the waves he struggled and kept his guard up
inside he was longing for something to be a part of
the brother was ready to beg steal borrow or barter

then a hurricane came and devastation reigned
our man saw his future drip dripping down the drain
put a pencil to his temple connected it to his brain
and he wrote his first refrain a testament to his pain

well the word got around they said this kid is insane man
took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
get your education dont forget from whence you came and
the world is gonna know your name whats your name man

alexander hamilton
my name is alexander hamilton
and theres a million things i havent done
but just you wait just you wait

when he was ten his father split full of it debtridden
two years later see alex and his mother bedridden
halfdead sittin in their own sick the scent thick

and alex got better but his mother went quick

moved in with a cousin the cousin committed suicide
left him with nothin but ruined pride something new inside
a voice saying

alex you gotta fend for yourself

he started retreatin and readin every treatise on the shelf

there would have been nothin left to do
for someone less astute
he woulda been dead or destitute
without a cent of restitution
started workin clerkin for his late mothers landlord
tradin sugar cane and rum and all the things he cant afford
scammin for every book he can get his hands on
plannin for the future see him now as he stands on
the bow of a ship headed for a new land
in new york you can be a new man

in new york you can be a new man

just you wait

in new york you can be a new man

just you wait

in new york you can be a new man
in new york
new york

just you wait

alexander hamilton
we are waiting in the wings for you
you could never back down
you never learned to take your time
oh alexander hamilton
when america sings for you
will they know what you overcame
will they know you rewrote the game
the world will never be the same oh

the ship is in the harbor now
see if you can spot him
another immigrant
comin up from the bottom
his enemies destroyed his rep
america forgot him

we fought with him

me i died for him

me i trusted him

me i loved him

and me im the damn fool that shot him

theres a million things i havent done
but just you wait

whats your name man

alexander hamilton

and now asapscience presents
the elements of the periodic table

theres hydrogen and helium
then lithium beryllium
boron carbon everywhere
nitrogen all through the air

with oxygen so you can breathe
and fluorine for your pretty teeth
neon to light up the signs
sodium for salty times

magnesium aluminium silicon
phosphorus then sulfur chlorine and argon
potassium and calcium so youll grow strong
scandium titanium vanadium and chromium and manganese


this is the periodic table
noble gas is stable
halogens and alkali react agressively
each period will see new outer shells
while electrons are added moving to the right

iron is the 26th
then cobalt nickel coins you get
copper zinc and gallium
germanium and arsenic

selenium and bromine film
while krypton helps light up your room
rubidium and strontium then yttrium zirconium

niobium molybdenum technetium
ruthenium rhodium palladium
silverware then cadmium and indium
tincans antimony then tellurium and iodine and xenon and then caesium and

barium is 56 and this is where the table splits
where lanthanides have just begun
lanthanum cerium and praseodymium

neodymiums next too
promethium then 62s
samarium europium gadolinium and terbium
dysprosium holmium erbium thulium
ytterbium lutetium

hafnium tantalum tungsten then were on to
rhenium osmium and iridium
platinum gold to make you rich till you grow old
mercury to tell you when its really cold

thallium and lead then bismuth for your tummy
polonium astatine would not be yummy
radon francium will last a little time
radium then actinides at 89

repeat

actinium thorium protactinium
uranium neptunium plutonium
americium curium berkelium
californium einsteinium fermium
mendelevium nobelium lawrencium
rutherfordium dubnium seaborgium
bohrium hassium then meitnerium
darmstadtium roentgenium copernicium

ununtrium flerovium
ununpentium livermorium
ununseptium ununoctium
and then were done

ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
but now it feels so strange out of the atmospheres
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
and then the jukebox plays a song i used to know
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
and now im staring at the bodies as theyre dancing so slow
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

they dont write em like that anymore
they dont write em like that anymore

now im winding up staring at an empty glass

midnight and im awaiting on the twelveohfive
hoping itll take me just a little farther down the line

moonlight youre just a heartache in disguise
so wont you keep my heart from breaking
if its only for a very short time

playing with the queen of hearts
knowing it aint really smart
the joker aint the only fool
wholl do anything for you

laying out another lie
thinking bout a life of crime
cause thats what ill have to do
to keep me away from you

honey you know it makes you mad
why is everybody telling everybody what you have done
baby i know it makes you sad
but when theyre handing out the heartaches
you know you got to have you some

playing with the queen of hearts
knowing it aint really smart
the joker aint the only fool
wholl do anything for you

laying out another lie
thinking bout a life of crime
cause thats what ill have to do
to keep me away from you

lovers i know youve had a few
so hide your heart beneath the covers
and tell em theyre the only one
and others they know just what im going through
and its ahard to be a lover
when you say youre only in it for fun

playing with the queen of hearts
knowing it aint really smart
the joker aint the only fool
wholl do anything for you

laying out another lie
thinking bout a life of crime
cause thats what ill have to do
to keep me away from you

playing with the queen of hearts
playing with the queen of hearts
playing with the queen of hearts
playing with the queen of hearts
playing with the queen of hearts

id do anything
to have you near me

forget the future
can we get closer
pull back your eyelids
im lost in your iris

dreaming about you

well never get free
lamb to the slaughter
what you gon do
when theres blood in the water
the price of your greed
is your son and your daughter
what you gon do
when theres blood in the water

look me in my eyes
tell me everythings not fine
or the people aint happy
and the river has run dry
you thought you could go free
but the system is done for
if you listen here closely
theres a knock at your front door

well never get free
lamb to the slaughter
what you gon do
when theres blood in the water
the price of your greed
is your son and your daughter
what you gon do
when theres blood in the water
when theres blood in the
when theres blood in the

beg me for mercy
admit you were toxic
you poisoned me just for
another dollar in your pocket
now i am the violence
i am the sickness
wont accept your silence
beg me for forgiveness

well never get free
lamb to the slaughter
what you gon do
when theres blood in the water
the price of your greed
is your son and your daughter
what you gon do
when theres blood in the water
when theres blood in the water
when theres blood in the water

i am the people
i am the storm
i am the riot
i am the swarm
when the last trees fallen
the animal cant hide
money wont solve it
whats your alibi

what you gon do when theres blood in the blood in the water
when theres blood in the water

so time to be my puppet on a string
ive had enough of you
oh dance my little muppet plaything

now
the audience is thirsty for fun
time to run
cause now your denouement has already begun
that means youre done

we could both be pirates on the sea
youll swab the deck and play your part for me
mops galore
youd better keep it clean
watch out now my little friend cause sharkspeares looking mean

ive had enough of you
so time to be my puppet on a string
ive had enough of you
oh dance my little muppet plaything

a battle like no other

at least youll get to see defeat in epic style

the audience is primed each attack right on time
seeing you entwined is so worthwhile
but why stop there
add a lion a bear
whats wrong my petite chère why dont you smile

the final act is sure to be a theatrical plot twist worthy of a prize

cause ive had enough of you
*
i studied evil i cant deny
was a hoodoo charm called a love me or die
some fingernail a piece of her dress
apocathery devils behes
i will relate the piteous consequence my mistake
falling slave to passing desire
making the dreaded love me or die

against a jungle primeval green
she had the looks of a beauty queen
no bangles or chain wearing broken shoe
seventyfive cent bottle perfume
i said good morning i tipped my hat
all the while i was cunning like a rat
smiling gaily looked her in the eye
i felt in pocket the love me or die

my past history one to behold
i studied magic from days of old
membership secret societies
power and wealth in my family
but matilda darling
why you dont take my wedding ring
like a demon under the floor
i buried the hoodoo down the back door

lawd word broke through the town
that a fever strike matilda down
nine thirty the doctor arrive
priest come running quarter to five
standing in the weeds early next day
i saw the meat wagon rolling away
i seen matilda laying in the back
her old mother wearing a suit of black

sound the trumpet and bang the drum
i wait for me judgement to come
i know her spirit is down beneath
i hear the weeping and gnashing of the teeth
flames of hell licks at my feet
in the shadow of the jungle i feel the heat
matildas waiting in hell for me too
all cause she died from a bad hoodoo
*
were talking away
i dont know what
im to say ill say it anyway
todays another day to find you
shying away
ill be coming for your love ok

take on me take me on
ill be gone
in a day or two

so needless to say
im odds and ends
but ill be stumbling away
slowly learning that life is ok
say after me
its no better to be safe than sorry

take on me take me on
ill be gone
in a day or two

oh the things that you say
is it life or
just to play my worries away
youre all the things ive got to
remember
youre shying away
ill be coming for you anyway

take on me take me on
ill be gone
in a day or two

take on me take me on
ill be gone
in a day or two

you think im a weirdo
but look out your window
its my decision
to make the world my vision
when i walk down the street
everything looks quite sweet

i think i might pass
on eating from this guys grass

arent you scared of the germs
this is how you get worms

anything can be food
if youre in the right mood
cause i am free
its the key
doesnt matter what people think of me
i pick things up from the ground
keep everything that i found

what will you do with this trash
its gonna give you a rash
i offer it to my friends
so they can see life through my lens

lalalalalalalala

my laugh is not gracious
but it is contagious
its important to share
all the joy you have spare

cause i am free
its the key
doesnt matter what people think of me

so i brush my teeth with goo
i drink my soup from my shoe
i keep mayo in my pocket
turn a snake into a puppet
toot to a solo flute
i like to sing in the nude
but only at the shopping center
the acoustics are much better
plant a sausage in the ground
so that a new pig comes around

cause i am free
its the key doesnt matter what people think of me

busted flat in baton rouge waiting for a train
and is feeling nearly as faded as my jeans
bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
it rode us all the way to new orleans

i pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
i was playing soft while bobby sang the blues
windshield wipers slapping time i was holding bobbys hand in mine
we sang every song that driver knew

freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose
nothing dont mean nothing honey if it aint free now now
and feeling good was easy lord when he sang the blues
you know feeling good was good enough for me
good enough for me and my bobby mcgee

from the kentucky coal mines to the california sun
hey bobby shared the secrets of my soul
through all kinds of weather through everything that we done
hey bobby baby kept me from the cold

one day up near salinas lord i let him slip away
hes looking for that home and i hope he finds it
but id trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
to be holding bobbys body next to mine

freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose
nothing thats all that bobby left me yeah
but feeling good was easy lord when he sang the blues
hey feeling good was good enough for me hmm hmm
good enough for me and my bobby mcgee

you want a taste of my brain
okay its yours anyway
a bite of my eye
alright i wont put up a fight

how bout today
you try eating someone else for a change
because the way things are going i wont last another day

as you open up my ribs the blood flows out like a river
you strip my bones away as you indulge in my liver

and the more that i am in pain
the more that youll gain
and to me that seems like a pretty fair trade

you bite
my nervous system ignites
the torment inspite
sacrifices must be made

one thing that youd never hear me say
is that im tired of living
funny thing that statement change today
good thing that im forgiving

strangers in the night exchanging glances
wondring in the night
what were the chances wed be sharing love
before the night was through

something in your eyes was so inviting
something in your smile was so exciting
something in my heart
told me i must have you

strangers in the night two lonely people
we were strangers in the night
up to the moment
when we said our first hello
little did we know
love was just a glance away
a warm embracing dance away and

ever since that night weve been together
lovers at first sight in love forever
it turned out so right
for strangers in the night

love was just a glance away
a warm embracing dance away

ever since that night weve been together
lovers at first sight in love forever
it turned out so right
for strangers in the night

i saved every letter you wrote me
from the moment i read them
i knew you were mine
you said you were mine
i thought you were mine

do you know what angelica said
when we saw your first letter arrive
she said

be careful with that one love
he will do what it takes to survive

you and your words flooded my senses
your sentences left me defenseless
you built me palaces out of paragraphs
you built cathedrals
im rereading the letters you wrote me
im searching and scanning for answers
in every line
for some kind of sign
and when you were mine
the world seemed to

burn
burn

you published the letters she wrote you
you told the whole world how you brought
this girl into our bed
in clearing your name you have ruined our lives
do you know what angelica said
when she read what youd done
she said
you have married an icarus
he has flown too close to the sun

you and your words obsessed with your legacy
your sentences border on senseless
and you are paranoid in every paragraph
how they perceive you

you you you

im erasing myself from the narrative
let future historians wonder how eliza
reacted when you broke her heart
you have torn it all apart
i am watching it
burn
watching it burn
the world has no right to my heart
the world has no place in our bed
they dont get to know what i said
im burning the memories
burning the letters that might have redeemed you
you forfeit all rights to my heart
you forfeit the place in our bed
you sleep in your office instead
with only the memories
of when you were mine
i hope that you burn

ive information vegetable animal and mineral
i know the kings of england and i quote the fights historical
from marathon to waterloo in order categorical
im very well acquainted too with matters mathematical
i understand equations both the simple and quadratical
about binomial theorem im teeming with a lot o news
with many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse

im very good at integral and differential calculus
i know the scientific names of beings animalculous
in short in matters vegetable animal and mineral
i am the very model of a modern majorgeneral

i know our mythic history king arthurs and sir caradocs
i answer hard acrostics ive a pretty taste for paradox
i quote in elegiacs all the crimes of heliogabalus
in conics i can floor peculiarities parabolous
i can tell undoubted raphaels from gerard dows and zoffanies
i know the croaking  from the frogs of aristophanes
then i can hum a fugue of which ive heard the musics din afore
and whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense pinafore

then i can write a washing bill in babylonic cuneiform
and tell you evry detail of caractacuss uniform
in short in matters vegetable animal and mineral

in fact when i know what is meant by mamelon and ravelin
when i can tell at sight a mauser rifle from a javelin
when such affairs as sorties and surprises im more wary at
and when i know precisely what is meant by commissariat
when i have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
when i know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery
in short when ive a smattering of elemental strategy
youll say a better majorgeneral has never sat a gee

for my military knowledge though im plucky and adventury
has only been brought down to the beginning of the century
but still in matters vegetable animal and mineral
i am the very model of a modern majorgeneral

everyone is dumb

close my eyes and disappear

i just wanna be the comic relief

you dont know what to believe

maybe thats why

i promised her rings for her fingers
sparkling flowers for her flaxen hair
i swore that id never set sail in foul weather
but stay by her side at the shore

faretheewell oh you barbary merchants
faretheewell to the spanish blockade
faretheewell to the straits of gibraltar
and the treacherous seas of cathay

i gave her my promise to marry
and took her sweet vow in return
i swore that id never set sail in foul weather
but stay by her side at the shore

i built her a cottage in chatham
gave her children to sit by the fire
i swore that id never set sail in foul weather
but stay by her side at the shore

but our cottage is to small for a sailor
whitout the blue sea and the sky
though i swore that id never set sail in foul weather
i left her behind at the shore

take me back oh you barbary merchants
let me risk the spanish blockade
carry me to the straits of gibraltar
and the treacherous seas of cathay

your story sad to tell
a teenage neer do well
most mixed up nondelinquent on the block
your futures so unclear now
whats left of your career now
cant even get a trade in on your smile

beauty school dropout
no graduation day for you
beauty school dropout
missed your midterms
and flunked shampoo
well at least you could have taken time
to wash and clean your clothes up
after spending all that dough
to have the doctor fix your nose up

baby get moving baby get movin
why keep your feeble hopes alive
what are you proving what are you provin
youve got the dream but not the drive

if you go for your diploma
you could join a steno pool
turn in your teasin comb
and go back to high school

beauty school dropout beauty school dropout
hanging around the corner store
beauty school dropout beauty school dropout
its about time you knew the score

well they couldnt teach you anything
you think youre such a looker
but no customer would go to you
unless she was a hooker

baby dont sweat it dont sweat it
youre not cut out to hold a job
better forget it forget it
who wants their hair done by a slob

now your bangs are curled your lashes whirled
but still the world is cruel
wipe off that angel face
and go back to high school

baby dont blow it
dont put my good advice to shame
baby you know it
even dear abbyd say the same

now ive called the shot get off the block
i really gotta fly
gotta be going to that malt shop in the sky

beauty school dropout beauty school dropout
go back to high school

words like violence
break the silence
come crashing in
into my little world
painful to me
pierce right through me
cant you understand
oh my little girl

all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm

vows are spoken
to be broken
feelings are intense
words are trivial
pleasures remain
so does the pain
words are meaningless
and forgettable

all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm

all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm

all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm

enjoy the silence

no new years day to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring
no song to sing
in fact heres just another ordinary day

no april rain
no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday within the month of june
but what it is is something true
made up of these three words that i must say to you

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

no summers high
no warm july
no harvest moon to light one tender august night
no autumn breeze
no falling leaves
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

no libra sun
no halloween
no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring
but what it is though old so new
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care i do
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care i do
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart of my heart
of my heart

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care i do
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart of my heart
baby of my heart
*
i can remember when we walked together
sharing a love i thought would last forever
moonlight to show the way so we can follow
waiting inside her eyes was my tomorrow

then something changed her mind her kisses told me
i had no loving arms to hold me

every day i wake up then i start to break up
lonely is a man without love
every day i start out then i cry my heart out
lonely is a man without love

every day i wake up then i start to break up
knowing that its cloudy above
every day i start out then i cry my heart out
lonely is a man without love

i cannot face this world thats fallen down on me
so if you see my girl please send her home to me
tell her about my heart thats slowly dying
say i cant stop myself from crying

every day i wake up then i start to break up
lonely is a man without love
every day i start out then i cry my heart out
lonely is a man without love

every day i wake up then i start to break up
knowing that its cloudy above
every day i start out then i cry my heart out
lonely is a man without love

every day i wake up then i start to break up
lonely is a man without love
every day i start out then i cry my heart out
lonely is a man without love

for your eyes only can see me through the night
for your eyes only i never need to hide
you can see so much in me
so much in me thats new
i never felt until i looked at you

for your eyes only only for you
you see what no one else can see
now im breaking free
for your eyes only only for you
the love i know you need in me
the fantasy you freed in me
only for you only for you

for your eyes only the nights are never cold
you really know me thats all i need to know
maybe im an open book
because i know youre mine
but you wont need to read between the lines

for your eyes only only for you

now im breaking free
for your eyes only only for you
the passions that collide in me
the wild abandoned side of me
only for you for your eyes only

nobody does it better
makes me feel sad for the rest
nobody does it half as good as you
baby youre the best

i wasnt looking
but somehow you found me
i tried to hide from your lovelight
but like heaven above me
the spy who loved me
is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

and nobody does it better
though sometimes i wish someone could
nobody does it quite the way you do
whyd you have to be so good

the way that you hold me
whenever you hold me
theres some kind of magic inside you
that keeps me from running
but just keep it coming
howd you learn to do the things you do

and nobody does it better
makes me feel sad for the rest
nobody does it half as good as you
baby baby darling youre the best

baby youre the best
baby youre the best
baby youre the best

my father never talked a lot
he just took a walk around the block
til all his anger took a hold of him
and then hed hit
my mother never cried a lot
she took the punches but she never fought
til she said im leaving and ill take the kids
so she did

i say theyre just the ones who gave me life
but i truly am my parents child

scattered cross my family line
im so good at telling lies
that came from my mothers side
told a million to survive
scattered cross my family line
god i have my fathers eyes
but my sisters when i cry
i can run but i cant hide
from my family line

its hard to put it into words
how the holidays will always hurt
i watch the fathers with their little girls
and wonder what i did to deserve this
how could you hurt a little kid
i cant forget i cant forgive you
cause now im scared that everyone i love will leave me

scattered cross my family line
im so good at telling lies
that came from my mothers side
told a million to survive
scattered cross my family line
god i have my fathers eyes
but my sisters when i cry
i can run but i cant hide
from my family line

from my family line

ohoh
all that i did to try to undo it
all of my pain and all your excuses
i was a kid but i wasnt clueless
someone who loves you wouldnt do this
all of my past i tried to erase it
but now i see would i even change it
might share a face and share a last name but
we are not the same same

scattered cross my family line
im so good at telling lies
that came from my mothers side
told a million to survive
scattered cross my family line
god i have my fathers eyes
but my sisters when i cry
i can run but i cant hide
from my family line

from my family line mmhm

raindrops keep falling on my head
and just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
nothin seems to fit
those raindrops are falling on my head they keep falling

so i just did me some talkin to the sun
and i said i didnt like the way he got things done
sleepin on the job
those raindrops are falling on my head they keep falling

but theres one thing i know
the blues he sends to meet me wont defeat me
it wont be long till happiness steps up to greet me

raindrops keep falling on my head
but that doesnt mean my eyes will soon be turnin red
cryings not for me
cause im never gonna stop the rain by complainin
because im free
nothings worrying me

watching every motion
in my foolish lovers game
on this endless ocean
finally lovers know no shame
turning and returning
to some secret place inside
watching in slow motion
as you turn around and say
take my breath away
take my breath away

watching i keep waiting
still anticipating love
never hesitating
to become the fated ones
turning and returning
to some secret place to hide
watching in slow motion
as you turn to me and say my love
take my breath away

through the hourglass i saw you
in time you slipped away
when the mirror crashed i called you
and turned to hear you say
if only for today
i am unafraid
take my breath away
take my breath away

watching every motion
in this foolish lovers game
haunted by the notion
somewhere theres a love in flames
turning and returning
to some secret place inside
watching in slow motion
as you turn my way and say
take my breath away my love
take my breath away my love
take my breath away my love
take my breath away

ive been here before
this miseenscène reminds me
of all my mistakes
as i know its not too late

to set adrift
on a new path
and move further away
from my former self every day

ill find my way in time in time
ill find my way in time in time

i know its not too late
i know its not too late
i know its not too late
i know its not too late

every night in my dreams
i see you i feel you
that is how i know you go on

far across the distance
and spaces between us
you have come to show you go on

near far wherever you are
i believe that the heart does go on
once more you open the door
and youre here in my heart
and my heart will go on and on

love can touch us one time
and last for a lifetime
and never let go till were gone

love was when i loved you
one true time i hold to
in my life well always go on

near far wherever you are
i believe that the heart does go on
once more you open the door
and youre here in my heart
and my heart will go on and on

youre here theres nothing i fear
and i know that my heart will go on
well stay forever this way
you are safe in my heart
and my heart will go on and on

now the flames they followed joan of arc
as she came riding through the dark
no moon to keep her armour bright
no man to get her through this very smoky night
she said im tired of the war
i want the kind of work i had before
a wedding dress or something white
to wear upon my swollen appetite

well im glad to hear you talk this way
you know ive watched you riding every day
and something in me yearns to win
such a cold and lonesome heroine
and who are you  she sternly spoke
to the one beneath the smoke
why im fire he replied
and i love your solitude i love your pride

then fire make your body cold
im going to give you mine to hold
saying this she climbed inside
to be his one to be his only bride
and deep into his fiery heart
he took the dust of joan of arc
and high above the wedding guests
he hung the ashes of her wedding dress

it was deep into his fiery heart
he took the dust of joan of arc
and then she clearly understood
if he was fire oh then she must be wood
i saw her wince i saw her cry
i saw the glory in her eye
myself i long for love and light
but must it come so cruel and oh so bright
*
she calls out to the man on the street
sir can you help me
its cold and ive nowhere to sleep
is there somewhere you can tell me

he walks on doesnt look back
he pretends he cant hear her
starts to whistle as he crosses the street
seems embarrassed to be there

oh think twice
cause its another day for you and me in paradise
oh think twice
its just another day for you you and me in paradise

she calls out to the man on the street
he can see shes been crying
shes got blisters on the soles of her feet
cant walk but shes trying

oh think twice
cause its another day for you and me in paradise
oh think twice
its just another day for you you and me in paradise

oh lord is there nothing more anybody can do
oh lord there must be something you can say

you can tell from the lines on her face
you can see that shes been there
probably been moved on from every place
cause she didnt fit in there

oh think twice
cause its another day for you and me in paradise
oh think twice
its just another day for you you and me in paradise

just think about

we pledge no more tears on our land
in wrath doubts dispelld we make our stand
arise ye who would not be slaves again
for hong kong may freedom reign

though deep is the dread that lies ahead
yet still with our faith on we tread
let blood rage afield our voice grows evermore
for hong kong may glory reign

stars may fade as darkness fills the air
through the mist a solitary trumpet flares
now to arms for freedom we fight with all might we strike
with valour wisdom both we stride

break now the dawn liberate our hong kong
in common breath revolution of our times
may people reign proud and free now and evermore
glory be to thee hong kong

are we really happy with this lonely game we play
looking for the right words to say
searching but not finding understanding anyway
were lost in this masquerade

both afraid to say were just too far away
from being close together from the start
we tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
were lost inside this lonely game we play

thoughts of leaving disappear each time i see your eyes
and no matter how hard i try
to understand the reason why we carry on this way
were lost in this masquerade

we tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
were lost inside this lonely game we play

thoughts of leaving disappear each time i see your eyes
and no matter how hard i try
to understand the reason why we carry on this way
were lost in a masquerade
were lost in a masquerade

and were lost in a masquerade

those schoolgirl days
of telling tales and biting nails are gone
but in my mind
i know they will still live on and on
but how do you thank someone
who has taken you from crayons to perfume
it isnt easy
but ill try

if you wanted the sky
i would write across the sky in letters
that would soar a thousand feet high
to sir with love

the time has come
for closing books and long last looks must end
and as i leave
i know that i am leaving my best friend
a friend who taught me right from wrong
and weak from strong
thats a lot to learn
what what can i give you in return
*
the other night i cried while thinking of having sex with you
not out of desire or shame but some subconscious impulse to feel pain
i wiped my tears on my face and neck and the backs of my ears
and said now its sweat now its sweat its sweat now

just to see you
its such a treasure
but when i feel you
my flesh yields no pleasure

and honey im cultured
im very sex positive
so what is this feeling
it aint so positive

i cant tell you if i like it i like it
what happens if i dont like it i like you
i cant tell you if i like it i like it
what happens if i dont like it its only

ok so ive been reading all the sex blogs and they all talk about how ok it is to be gay and straight and bisexual and asexual and have sex however you like but i dont care about hundreds of hypothetical people and their hypothetical sex deals i care about me and my sex deal what about my problems

baby my body
constantly betrays me
i try to betray it
i only hurt myself

it didnt just singe the hair it made it straight

i cant tell you if i like it i like it
what happens if i dont like it i like it
i cant tell you if i like it i like it
what happens if i dont like it its only

its only sex
its only
its only sex
come on sexual desire speak

i want to hold you tight
i want to feel your love physically
i want to sleep with you
but only in the literal sense

i cant tell you if i like it i like it
what happens if i dont like it i like you
i cant tell you if i like it i like it
what happens if i dont like it its only sex

i only wanted to have fun
learning to fly learning to run
i let my heart decide the way
when i was young
deep down i must have always known
that it would be inevitable
to earn my stripes id have to pay
and bear my soul

i know im not the only one
who regrets the things theyve done
sometimes i just feel its only me
who cant stand the reflection that they see
i wish i could live a little more
look up to the sky not just the floor
i feel like my life is flashing by
and all i can do is watch and cry
i miss the air i miss my friends
i miss my mother i miss it when
life was a party to be thrown
but that was a million years ago
a million years ago

when i walk around all of the streets
where i grew up and found my feet
they cant look me in the eye
its like theyre scared of me
i try to think of things to say
like a joke or a memory
but they dont recognize me now
in the light of day

i know im not the only one
who regrets the things theyve done
sometimes i just feel its only me
who never became who they thought theyd be
i wish i could live a little more
look up to the sky not just the floor
i feel like my life is passing by
and all i can do is watch and cry
i miss the air i miss my friends
i miss my mother i miss it when
life was a party to be thrown
but that was a million years ago
a million years ago

the afternoon has gently passed me by
the evening spreads its sail against the sky
waiting for tomorrow
just another day
god bid yesterday goodbye

bring on the night
i couldnt stand another hour of daylight
bring on the night
i couldnt stand another hour of daylight

the future is but a question mark
hangs above my head there in the dark
cant see for the brightness
is staring me blind
god bid yesterday goodbye

bring on the night
i couldnt stand another hour of daylight
bring on the night
i couldnt stand another hour of daylight

a place where nobody dared to go
the love that we came to know
they call it xanadu
it takes your breath and leave you blind

and now open your eyes and see
what we have made is real
we are in xanadu
a dream of it we offer you

a million lights are dancing and there you are
a shooting star
an everlasting world and youre here with me

when marimba rhythms start to play
dance with me make me sway
like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
hold me close sway me more

like a flower bending in the breeze
bend with me sway with ease
when we dance you have a way with me
stay with me sway with me

other dancers may be on the floor
dear but my eyes will see only you
only you have the magic technique
when we sway i go weak

i can hear the sounds of violins
long before it begins
make me thrill as only you know how
sway me smooth sway me now

other dancers may be on the floor
dear but my eyes will see only you
only you have the magic technique
when we sway i go weak

i can hear the sounds of violins
long before it begins
make me thrill as only you know how
sway me smooth sway me now
you know how
sway me smooth sway me now

oh the night is my world
city lights painted girls
in the day nothing matters
its the nighttime that flatters
in the night no control
through the wall somethings breaking
wearing white as youre walkin
down the street of my soul

you take my self you take my self control
you got me livin only for the night
before the morning comes the storys told
you take my self you take my self control

another night another day goes by
i never stop myself to wonder why
you help me to forget to play my role
you take my self you take my self control

i i live among the creatures of the night
i havent got the will to try and fight
against a new tomorrow so i guess ill just believe it
that tomorrow never comes

a safe night im living in the forest of my dream
i know the night is not as it would seem
i must believe in something so ill make myself believe it
that this night will never go

ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh
ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh

oh the night is my world
city light painted girl

hello hello
can you hear me
as i scream your name
hello hello
do you need me
before i fade away

is this a place that i call home
to find what ive become
walk along the path unknown
we live we love we lie
deep in the dark
i dont need the light
theres a ghost inside me
it all belongs to the other side
we live we love we lie

hello hello
nice to meet you
voice inside my head
hello hello
i believe you
how can i forget
*
sweet talk and pretty face
i got beat at my own game
you came around
made me lose my mind
a lovely crime
around a glass of wine

you broke into my sinful life
you shot me down and stole my heart
with just a look you locked me up
i guess its bad luck

youre a dangerous woman
youre a dangerous woman

call a priest call my mother
cuz lucifer is going back to being an angel
ive found redemption in a foxy incarnation
im giving up my reign in hell to spend a day in eden

youre the best woman for the worst of men
you bring some heaven to my wicked land
cross my heart and hope to die
you leave me high and dry

youre a dangerous woman
youre a dangerous woman

you heard my prayers
my cry for danger
you came down to me like the darkest of angels
but your salvation
feels like damnation
im prey to the worst of assassinations

youre a dangerous woman
youre a dangerous woman

just like cyanide
i will breathe your lies
you could break my heart
and i would still come right back
you caught me off guard
i have lost this fight
so come on and end me
im at your mercy

youre a dangerous woman
wooh
youre a dangerous woman
youre a dangerous woman
youre a dangerous woman

do you ever feel
like a plastic bag
drifting through the wind
wanting to start again
do you ever feel
feel so paper thin
like a house of cards
one blow from caving in

do you ever feel
already buried deep
six feet under screams
but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that theres
still a chance for you
cause theres a spark in you

you just gotta ignite the light
and let it shine
just own the night
like the 4th of july

cause baby youre a firework
come on show em what youre worth
make em go oh oh oh
as you shoot across the skyyy

baby youre a firework
come on let your colors burst
make em go oh oh oh
youre gonna leave em all in awe awe awe

you dont have to feel
like a waste of space
youre original
cannot be replaced
if you only knew
what the future holds
after a hurricane
comes a rainbow

maybe youre reason why
all the doors are closed
so you could open one
that leads you to the perfect road
like a lightning bolt
your heart will blow
and when its time youll know

you just gotta ignite the light
and let it shine
just own the night
like the 4th of july

cause baby youre a firework
come on show em what youre worth
make em go oh oh oh
as you shoot across the skyyy

baby youre a firework
come on let your colors burst
make em go oh oh oh
youre gonna leave em all in awe awe awe

i have never heard that song before
but if i dont hear it anymore

its still familiar to me
sends a thrill right through me
cause those chords remind me
of the night that i first fell in love to

those magic changes
my heart arranges
a melody thats never the same
a melody thats callin your name
and begs you please come back to me
please return to me
dont go away again
oh make them play again
the music i wanna hear as once again
you whisper in my ear
oh my darlin uh huh

ill be waitin by the radio
youll come back to me someday i know
been so lonesome since your last goodbye
but im singin as i cryyay

while the bass is sounding
while the drums are pounding
beatings of my broken heart
well rise to first place on the charts

oh my heart arranges
those magic changes
*
dont know why
im survivin every lonely day
when theres got to be no chance for me
my life would end
and it doesnt matter how i cry

suzanne takes you down
to her place near the river
you can hear the boats go by
you can spend the night beside her
and you know that shes half crazy
but thats why you want to be there
and she feeds you tea and oranges
that come all the way from china
and just when you mean to tell her
that you have no love to give her
then she gets you on her wavelength
and she lets the river answer
that youve always been her lover

and you want to travel with her
and you want to travel blind
and you know that she will trust you
for youve touched her perfect body with your mind

and jesus was a sailor
when he walked upon the water
and he spent a long time watching
from his lonely wooden tower
and when he knew for certain
only drowning men could see him
he said all men will be sailors then
until the sea shall free them
but he himself was broken
long before the sky would open
forsaken almost human
he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

and you want to travel with him
and you want to travel blind
and you think maybe youll trust him
for hes touched your perfect body with his mind

now suzanne takes your hand
and she leads you to the river
she is wearing rags and feathers
from salvation army counters
and the sun pours down like honey
on our lady of the harbour
and she shows you where to look
among the garbage and the flowers
there are heroes in the seaweed
there are children in the morning
they are leaning out for love
and they will lean that way forever
while suzanne holds the mirror

and you want to travel with her
and you want to travel blind
and you know that you can trust her
for shes touched your perfect body with her mind
*
i hear the drums echoing tonight
but she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
shes coming in 1230 flight
her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
i stopped an old man along the way
hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
he turned to me as if to say
hurry boy its waiting there for you

its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had

the wild dogs cry out in the night
as they grow restless longing for some solitary company
i know that i must do whats right
as sure as kilimanjaro rises like olympus above the serengeti
i seek to cure whats deep inside
frightened of this thing that ive become

its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had

hurry boy shes waiting there for you

its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had

one two three four counting every day
ive been stuck in here can someone help me get away
five six seven eight time is just a hoax
in a colored world of characters and family jokes

you must think that youre dreaming
just tell me what youre scheming
you look like youve seen a ghost
youre lucky to have such a gracious host like me
im scared to lose myself here
but there is nothing to fear
i cant take it anymore
is that an exit door

just your imagination
the exit is your fixation
door after door youll find that its just a digital hallucination
you try to find a way out
but youre stuck here day after day
inside a digital hallucination
ohohohohohohoh
ohohohohohohoh

a b c d i dont know my name
tell me if im dead or if im just going insane
x d d c the writing on the wall
the vowels and the consonants says save us all

you must think that youre dreaming
itll be ok believe me
you look like youve seen a ghost
youre lucky to have whats left of your sanity
and some might call it tragic
when the circus lost its magic
i cant take it any more
is that an exit door

just your imagination
the exit is your fixation
door after door youll find that its just a digital hallucination
you try to find a way out
but youre stuck here day after day
inside a digital hallucination
ohohohohohohoh
ohohohohohohoh

is it an amalgamation
of my own fixation
day after day i find that it is just
a digital hallucination
i want to find a way out
but im stuck here day after day
inside this digital hallucination

just your imagination
the exit is your fixation
door after door youll find that it is just a digital hallucination
you try to find a way out
but youre stuck here day after day
inside a digital hallucination

digital hallucination ohohohohohohoh
get me out of here ohohohohohohoh

i could feel at the time
there was no way of knowing
fallen leaves in the night
who can say where theyre blowing
as free as the wind
hopefully learning
why the sea on the tide
has no way of turning

more than this
you know theres nothing
more than this
tell me one thing
more than this
ooh theres nothing

it was fun for a while
there was no way of knowing
like a dream in the night
who can say where were going
no care in the world
maybe im learning
why the sea on the tide
has no way of turning

more than this
you know theres nothing
more than this
tell me one thing
more than this
ooh theres nothing

oh the night is my world
city lights painted girls
in the day nothing matters
its the night time that flatters

in the night no control
through the wall somethings breaking
wearing white as youre walkin
down the street of my soul

you take my self you take my self control
you got me livin only for the night
before the morning comes the storys told
you take my self you take my self control

another night another day goes by
i never stop myself to wonder why
you help me to forget to play my role
you take my self you take my self control

i i live among the creatures of the night
i havent got the will to try and fight
against a new tomorrow so i guess ill just believe it
that tomorrow never comes

a safe night im living in the forest of my dream
i know the night is not as it would seem
i must believe in something so ill make myself believe it
that this night will never go

oh the night is my world

its not unusual to be loved by anyone
its not unusual to have fun with anyone
but when i see you hanging about with anyone
its not unusual to see me cry i wanna die

its not unusual to go out at any time
but when i see you out and about its such a crime
if you should ever wanna be loved by anyone
its not unusual

it happens everyday no matter what you say
youll find it happens all the time
love will never do what you want it to
why cant this crazy love be mine

its not unusual to be mad with anyone
its not unusual to be sad with anyone
but if i ever find that youve changed at any time
its not unusual to find that im in love with you

look at these trophies
see how my trophies gleam in the sunlight
see how they shine
what do you think it took to become
english hammerthrowing champion 1959

do you think in that moment
when my big moment came
that i treated the rules
with casual disdain
well like hell

as i stepped up to the circle did i change my plan
hmm what
as i chalked up my palms did i wave my hands
i did not
as i started my spin did i look at the view
did i drift off and dream for a minute or two
do you think i faltered or amended my rotation
do you think i altered my intended еlevation
as the hammer took off did i changе my grunt
from the grunt i had practiced for many a month
not a jot not a dot did i stray from the plot
not a detail of my throw was adjusted or forgotten
not even when the hammer left my hands
and sailed high up up above the stands
did i let myself go
no no no no no no no no

shes done it she is the best

if you want to throw the hammer for your country
you have to stay inside the circle all the time
and if you want to make the team
you dont need happiness or selfesteem
you just need to keep your feet inside the line
sing children 2 3 4

if you want to throw the hammer for your country
bambinautm est magitum
you have to stay inside the circle all the time
circulum magitum magitum

and if you want to teach success
you dont use sympathy or tenderness

find the bally line and toe it
and always keep your feet inside the line

now get out

theres a place you are sent if you havent been good
and its made of spikes and wood
and it isnt wide enough to sit and even if you could
there are nails on the bottom so youll wish youd stood

when the hinges creak and the door is closed
you cannot see squat not the end of your nose
and when you scream you dont know if the sounds came out
or if the scream in your head even reached your mouth

instead of spa well drink brown ale
and pay the reckoning on the nail
for debt no man shall go yo jail
from garryowen in glory

we are the boys who take delight
in smashing limerick lamps at night
and through the street like sportsters fight
tearing all before us

instead of spa well drink brown ale
and pay the reckoning on the nail
for debt no man shall go to jail
from garryowen in glory

well break windows well break doors
the watch knock down by threes or fours
then let the doctors work their cures
and tinker up our bruishes

instead of spa well drink brown ale
and pay the reckoning on the nail
for debt no man shall go to jail
from garryowen in glory

well beat the bailiffs out of fun
well make the mayor and sheriffes run
we are the boys no man dare run
if regards a whole skin

instead of spa well drink brown ale
and pay the reckoning on the nail
for debt no man shall go to jail
from garryowen in glory

our hearts so stout got us fame
for soon tis known from whence we came
wherere we go they dread the name
from garryowen in glory

instead of spa well drink brown ale
and pay the reckoning on the nail
for debt no man shall go to jail
of garryowen in glory

when a mans an empty kettle
he should be on his mettle1
and yet im torn apart

just because im presumin
that i could be kind o human
if i only had a heart

id be tender id be gentle
and awful sentimental
regarding love and art

id be friends with the sparrows
and the boy who shoots the arrows
if i only had a heart

picture me a balcony2
above a voice sings low
wherefore art thou romeo
i hear a beat
how sweet

just to register emotion
jealousy devotion
and really feel the part

i could stay young and chipper
and id lock it with a zipper
if i only had a heart

night is draggin her feet
i wait alone in the heat
i know know that youll have your way
till you have to go home
nos a word i cant say

cause it gets me nowhere to tell you no
and it gets me nowhere to make you go
will a little more love make you start depending
will a little more love bring a happy ending
will a little more love make it right
will a little more love make it right

where where did my innocence go
how how was a young girl to know
im trapped trapped in the spell of your eyes
in the warmth of your arms
in the web of your lies

but it gets me nowhere to tell you no
and it gets me nowhere to make you go
will a little more love make you start depending
will a little more love bring a happy ending
will a little more love make it right
will a little more love make it right

verse 1
i got no time
i got no time to live
i got no time to live and i cant say good bye
and im regretting having memories
of my friends who they used to be
beside me before they left me to die

and i know this is
i know this is the truth
cause ive been staring at my death so many times
these scary monsters roaming in the halls
i wish i could just block the doors
and stay in bed until the clock will chime


so my flashlights on and stay up till dawn
i got this headache and my lifes on the line
i felt like i won but i wasnt done
the nightmare repeats itself every time

got to keep my calm and carry on
stay awake until the sun will shine
but im not so strong and theyre not gone
theyre still out there to take whats left of mine

verse 2
i have this urge
i have this urge to kill
i have this urge to kill and show that im alive
im getting sick from these apologies
from people with priorities
that their life matters so much more than mine

but im stuttering
im stuttering again
no will listen and no one will understand
because im crying as much as i speak
cause no one likes me when i shriek
want to go back to when it all began


*
we pledge no more tears on our land
in wrath doubts dispelld we make our stand
arise ye who would not be slaves again
for hong kong may freedom reign

though deep is the dread that lies ahead
yet still with our faith on we tread
let blood rage afield our voice grows evermore
for hong kong may glory reign

stars may fade as darkness fills the air
through the mist a solitary trumpet flares
now to arms for freedom we fight with all might we strike
with valour wisdom both we stride

break now the dawn liberate our hong kong
in common breath revolution of our times
may people reign proud and free now and evermore
glory be to thee hong kong

well i dreamed i saw the knights in armor coming
sayin something about a queen
there were peasants singin and drummers drumming
and the archer split the tree
there was a fanfare blowin to the sun
that was floating on the breeze
look at mother nature on the run
in the nineteen seventies
look at mother nature on the run
in the nineteen seventies

i was lyin in a burned out basement
with a full moon in my eyes
i was hopin for a replacement
when the sun burst through the sky
there was a band playin in my head
and i felt like getting high
i was thinkin about what a friend had said
i was hopin it was a lie
thinkin about what a friend had said
i was hopin it was a lie

well i dreamed i saw the silver spaceships flying
in the yellow haze of the sun
there were children crying and colors flying
all around the chosen ones
all in a dream all in a dream
the loading had begun
flyin mother natures silver seed
to a new home in the sun
flyin mother natures silver seed
to a new home

i hope that our few remaining friends
give up on trying to save us

i hope we come out with a failsafe plot
to piss off the dumb few that forgave us

i hope the fences we mended
fall down beneath their own weight

and i hope we hang on past the last exit
i hope its already too late

and i hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
someday burns down
and i hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
and i never come back to this town again in my life

i hope i lie
and tell everyone you were a good wife
and i hope you die
i hope we both die

i hope i cut myself shaving tomorrow
i hope it bleeds all day long
our friends say its darkest before the sun rises
were pretty sure theyre all wrong

i hope it stays dark forever
i hope the worst isnt over
and i hope you blink before i do
and i hope i never get sober

and i hope when you think of me years down the line
you cant find one good thing to say
and id hope that if i found the strength to walk out
youd stay the hell out of my way

i am drowning
there is no sign of land
you are coming down with me
hand in unlovable hand

and i hope you die
i hope we both die
*
when i look back upon my life
its always with a sense of shame
ive always been the one to blame
for everything i long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

its a its a its a its a sin
its a sin
everything ive ever done
everything i ever do
every place ive ever been
everywhere im going to
its a sin

at school they taught me how to be
so pure in thought and word and deed
they didnt quite succeed
for everything i long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

its a its a its a its a sin
its a sin
everything ive ever done
everything i ever do
every place ive ever been
everywhere im going to
its a sin

father forgive me i tried not to do it
turned over a new leaf then tore right through it
whatever you taught me i didnt believe it
father you fought me cause i didnt care
and i still dont understand

so i look back upon my life
forever with a sense of shame
ive always been the one to blame
for everything i long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

its a its a its a its a sin
its a sin
everything ive ever done
everything i ever do
every place ive ever been
everywhere im going to its a sin
its a its a its a its a sin
its a its a its a its a sin

lost without you
lost without you
lost without you
lost without you

ive been riding this train for so long
searching for a place to call my own
a place to call my own
accelerating beyond control
im going faster than a speeding bullet
from where my heart calls

lost without you
im tired of running baby
lost without you

i just cant forget the past lost without you
im tired of running baby
lost without you
i just cant forget the past
lost without you

dont know what id do if i lost you again
ill hold you through the night
hold you through the night

im lost without you
i dont know where id be if you werent in my life
together till the end

these tracks keep running full circle
and there you are each time i look into your eyes
theres no doubt i cant keep going on
someone stop this train before
i lose my mind

lost without you
im tired of running baby
lost without you
i just cant forget the past

we live in a free world
i whistle down the wind
carry on smiling
and the world will smile with you
life is a flower
so precious in your hand
carry on smiling
and the world will smile with you

when every race is run
and the day is closing in
i dont care about the world
im living for the light
dont cry for me today ahah ah

we live in a free world
i whistle down the wind

i can not be your judge
mr jailer is your host
hes keeping you inside
and hides you from the world
no catcher in the rye
can help you from yourself

we live in a free world
i whistle down the wind

please mr agony
release them for a while
learn them the consequences of
living without life

we live in a free world
repeat fade

this old man and me were at the bar and we
were having us some beers and swappin idontcares
talking politics blonde and redhead chicks
old dogs and new tricks and habits we aint kicked
we talked about gods grace and all the hell we raised
then i heard the ol man say
god is great beer is good and people are crazy

he said i fought two wars been married and divorced
what brings you to ohio he said damned if i know
we talked an hour or two bout every girl we knew
what all we put them through like two old boys will do
we pondered life and death he lit a cigarette
said these damn things will kill me yet
but god is great beer is good and people are crazy

last call was 2 am i said goodbye to him
i never talked to him again

then one sunny day i saw the old mans face
front page obituary he was a millionairee
he left his fortune to some guy he barely knew
his kids were mad as hell but meim doing well
and i dropped by today to just say thanks and pray
and i left a sixpack right there on his grave
and i said god is great beer is good and people are crazy

god is great beer is good and people are crazy

god is great beer is good and people are crazy

all i wanted was a sweet distraction for an hour or two
had no intention to do the things weve done
funny how it always goes with love when you dont look you find
but then were two of a kind we move as one

were in all time high
well change all thats gone before
doing so much more than falling in love
on an all time high
well take on the world and wait
so hold on tight let the flight begin

i dont want to waste a waking moment i dont want to sleep
im in so strong and so deep and so are you
in my time ive said these words before but now i realize
my heart was telling me lies for you theyre true

were an all time high
well change all thats gone before
doing so much more than falling in love
on an all time high
well take on the world and wait
so hold on tight let the flight begin

so hold on tight let the flight begin
were an all time high

always want what i cant have
the resisting drives me mad
pulls me closer when you go
i want you more


you walk away
and then you stay
in disguise
want you to be
the one i see
in your eyes

i dont want to close the door
let me dream a little longer
want to read between the lines
in your eyes
i dont want to close the door
dont want to hear you say its over
there is love between the lines
in your eyes

always want what i cant get
if i love i wont regret
the feelings stronger and i know
i want you more



this is more than imagination
this is how its supposed to feel
it goes deeper than what i know is real
in your eyes

she leads a lonely life
she leads a lonely life

when she woke up late in the morning light
and the day had just begun
she opened up her eyes and thought
oh what a morning
its not a day for work
its a day for catching tan
just lying on the beach and having fun
shes going to get you

all that she wants is another baby
shes gone tomorrow boy
all that she wants is another baby yeah
all that she wants is another baby
shes gone tomorrow boy
all that she wants is another baby yeah

all that she wants
all that she wants

so if you are in sight and the day is right
shes the hunter youre the fox
the gentle voice that talks to you
wont talk forever
its a night for passion
but the morning means goodbye
beware of what is flashing in her eyes
shes going to get you

than i was giving you

and i could be wrong

and suddenly
ive gone a little

crazy
without her next to me
if only she could see
i never thought shed be

lightyears away
ooh i gotta get her
right here so i can say
oooh im falling
and its quite clear what i should do my darling
with these lightyears im feeling between me and you

no word from you
and im starting to fear
no message coming through
but the message is clear

are you moving on
are you forgetting the magic we had all night long
i can see
ive gone a little

crazy

the thought is haunting me
i never thought shed be

lightyears away
ooh i gotta get her
right here so i can say
oooh im falling
and its quite clear what i should do my darling
with these lightyears im feeling between me and you

right here so i can say
oooh im falling
and its quite clear what i should do my darling

you stare at the walls try to figure out it all
yet blank thoughts appearing your minds never clearing

are you alive or just existing

one minute down
two hours now
ill wait for you
as long as u need me to

ill make it right
plant flowers in your heart
dig demons from your hurt
ill make it better
ill wait for you
ill wait for you

everyone says that our loves not right
but who says love only has one side

are we alive or just existing
we need to open up and listen

one minute down
two hours now
ill wait for you
as long as u need me to

ill make it right
plant flowers in your heart
dig demons from your hurt
ill make it better

you walk into the room i go quiet
i catch your eyes and dont blink an eyelid
feels like the world locked us on an island
an island without waves

i try and try to forget you
but your mother thinks im the best for you
i try and try to erase you
but you wont disappear

feels like every time i turn a corner youre standin right there
over my shoulder youre everywhere
i swear its hard to think its hard to breathe when youre in the air
i try to run but youre everywhere i go
when i think im all alone
and my hearts under control
why is lovin you not fair
youre everywhere

the ground beneath my feets a bit colder
i see your face in people i dont know
feels like the world is twistin in slomo
and im stuck in one place

i try and try to forget you
but your mother thinks im the best for you
i try and try to erase you
but you wont disappear

feels like every time i turn a corner youre standin right there
over my shoulder youre everywhere
i swear its hard to think its hard to breathe when youre in the air
i try to run but youre everywhere i go
when i think im all alone
and my hearts under control
why is lovin you not fair
youre everywhere

everywhere
everywhere i go
but youre still not here
and youre still not here

feels like every time i turn a corner youre standin right there
swear its hard to think its hard to breathe when youre in the air
feels like every time i turn a corner youre standin right there
over my shoulder youre everywhere
i swear its hard to think its hard to breathe when youre in the air
i try to run but youre everywhere i go
when i think im all alone all alone
and my hearts under control

of being lonely

so many words
for the broken heart

in a crimson love
so hard to breathe

nights of light

will be done they tell me

of being lonely

i need to walk with
tell me why
i cant be there where you are
theres something missing in my heart

they never say
forever gaze if only

guilty roads
to an endless love

will be done they tell me

the door it opened slowly
my father he came in
i was nine years old
and he stood so tall above me
his blue eyes they were shining
and his voice was very cold
he said ive had a vision
and you know im strong and holy
i must do what ive been told
so he started up the mountain
i was running he was walking
and his axe was made of gold

well the trees they got much smaller
the lake a ladys mirror
we stopped to drink some wine
then he threw the bottle over
broke a minute later
and he put his hand on mine
thought i saw an eagle
but it might have been a vulture
i never could decide
then my father built an altar
he looked once behind his shoulder
he knew i would not hide

you who build these altars now
to sacrifice these children
you must not do it anymore
a scheme is not a vision
and you never have been tempted
by a demon or a god
you who stand above them now
your hatchets blunt and bloody
you were not there before
when i lay upon a mountain
and my fathers hand was trembling
with the beauty of the world

and if you call me brother now
forgive me if i inquire
just according to whose plan
when it all comes down to dust
i will kill you if i must
i will help you if i can
when it all comes down to dust
i will help you if i must
i will kill you if i can
and mercy on our uniform
man of peace or man of war
the peacock spreads his fan
*
hey all hey all
welcome to the greatest storm
i know i know
you have waited much too long
and i and i
i will be your shining star
im here im here
here to conquer near and far

like the sun i run
into the heat of day
like a knight i fight
until the fight is won
in a rage ill save
each and every each and every each and every one
till this war is won

and i live to rule by the sword
slashing through the every inch of the power
the power in you
as i sit as i stand
by the table i command
my kingdom
im the knight of the wind

hey all hey all
welcome to the end its near
i know i know
i will bring you pain and fear

on the ground to the sky
faced with you and i
in a flash im gone
holding your crown high
in a rage ill save
each and every each and every each and every one
till this war is won

and ill live to rule by the sword
slashing through the every inch of the power
the power in you
as i sit as i stand
by the table i command
my kingdom
im the knight of the wind

the knight of the wind

our castle is a massive force
a stronghold of power
my armor stays unbreakable
in battle every hour

looking for the fight of her life
in the real time world no one sees her at all
they all say shes crazy

locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
changing movement into light
she has danced into the danger zone
when the dancer becomes the dance

it can cut you like a knife
if the gift becomes the fire
on the wire between will and what will be

shes a maniac maniac on the floor
and shes dancing like shes never danced before
shes a maniac maniac on the floor
and shes dancing like shes never danced before

on the ice blue line of insanity
is a place most never see
its a hard won place of mystery
touch it but cant hold it

you work all your life for that moment in time
it could come or pass you by
its a pushshove world but theres always a chance
if the hunger stays the night

theres a cold kinetic heat
struggling stretching for the peak
never stopping with her head against the wind

shes a maniac maniac i sure know
and shes dancing like shes never danced before
shes a maniac maniac i sure know
and shes dancing like shes never danced before

it can cut you like a knife
if the gift becomes the fire
on the wire between will and what will be

shes a maniac maniac i sure know
and shes dancing like shes never danced before
shes a maniac maniac i sure know
and shes dancing like shes never danced before
shes a maniac maniac i sure know
and shes dancing like shes never danced before

born under a bad sign
ive been down since i began to crawl
if it wasnt for bad luck
i wouldnt have no luck at all

bad luck and trouble is my only friend
ive been down ever since i was ten

born under a bad sign
ive been down since i began to crawl
if it wasnt for bad luck
i wouldnt have no luck at all

i cant read never learned how to write
my whole life has been one big fight

born under a bad sign
ive been down since i began to crawl
if it wasnt for bad luck
i wouldnt have no luck at all

wine and women thats all i crave
a biglegged woman will carry me to my grave

born under a bad sign
ive been down since i began to crawl
if it wasnt for bad luck
i wouldnt have no luck
if it wasnt for real bad luck
i wouldnt have no luck at all

ive been on the road too long
moving in the wrong direction
i dont know where i belong
i dont know what i will do
if i cant get back home

troubles i got all my own and
they dont fit no other person
the memories keep rolling on
and i dont know what i will do
if i cant get back home

i dont fit but i dont give a damn
i wont quit because i know who i am
and ill admit and ive been on the lamb

bit by bit ill review my plan
this is it do the best i can
trust and understand

because i know that i am loved
and ill be on my way
got no need to stay around here

ive been on the road too long
moving in the wrong direction
i dont know where i belong
i dont know what i will do
if i cant get back home

at first i didnt realize
i needed all this stuff
i had a little cottage
and that cottage was enough
a place where i could sit and knit
a place where i could sell my thneeds
but now ive had a little time
to reassess my needs

and i need a bigger office
i need a bigger chair
a bigger desk
a bigger staff
a bigger hat to wear

because im biggering
yes biggering
im figuring on biggering
and biggering is triggering
more biggering

hey listen up meathead
im a say this once and im not gonna repeat it
greed see its like a little pet all right
and the more and more and more that you go and feed it
the more hungry itll get
but you know you really cant blame greed
naw thats stupid
you see its got a worm inside
oh yeah thats right
thats one that always needs to feed
and it is never satisfied
you get it

but the more you try to find it
the more it likes to hide
now listen
that is a nasty little worm
i like to call it pride
see now thats why youre biggering
listen here idiot
and figuring on biggering
but that biggerings just triggering more biggering
got that
all right

there is a principle of nature
that most every creature knows
its called survival of the fittest
and this is how it goes
the animal that wins has got to claw and bite and kick and punch
the animal that doesnt winds up someone elses lunch

a companys an animal thats trying to survive
its struggling and fighting just to keep itself alive

i must keep biggering
im figuring on biggering
though biggering is triggering
more biggering
i wont stop biggering
im figuring on biggering
and biggering is triggering more biggering

with the customers all buying
and the money multiplying
and the pr people lying
and the lawyers all denying
who cares if some things are dying
i dont want to hear your crying
this is all so gratifying

when youre alone and life is making you lonely
you can always go downtown
when youve got worries all the noise and the hurry

just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty

so go downtown
things will be great when youre downtown
no finer place for sure downtown
everythings waiting for you

dont hang around and let your problems surround you

maybe you know some little places to go to
where they never close downtown

you can forget all your troubles forget all your cares

so go downtown
where all the lights are bright downtown
waiting for you tonight downtown
youre gonna be alright now downtown

dont wait a minute more downtown
everything is waiting for you downtown

kissing goodbye
tears in her eyes
its the last time the last time you can be sure of
but i can taste the salty kisses and the runny makeup
yea it could be so boring

but she keeps crying
and they keep kissing
and i just hang about and listen

shes got to go
shes got to go
in the airport in the morning and i know
shes got to go

now its time they know

a shooting star fell down to earth
lightning cracked the sky
something weird is happening
something i cant deny

a strange kind of magic
running through my brain
feel im in heaven
or going insane

cause everytime we touch
i get this feeling
and everytime we kiss
i swear i could fly

cant you hear my heart beat fast
i want this to last
need you by my side

cause everytime we touch
i feel ecstatic
and everytime we kiss
i reach for the sky

cant you hear my heart beat so
i cant let you go
want you in my life

the wind was like a hurricane
storm clouds filled the sky
i heard a crash of thunder
the earth shook in reply

a strange kind of magic
running through my brain
feel like im in heaven
or going insane

cause everytime we touch
i get this feeling
and everytime we kiss
i swear i could fly

cant you hear my heart beat fast
i want this to last
need you by my side

cause everytime we touch
i feel ecstatic
and everytime we kiss
i reach for the sky

cant you hear my heart beat so
i cant let you go
want you in my life

when you wish upon a star
makes no difference who you are
anything your heart desires
will come to you

if your heart is in your dream
no request is too extreme
when you wish upon a star
as dreamers do

fate is kind
she brings to those who love
the sweet fulfillment of
their secret longing

like a bolt out of the blue
suddenly it comes in view
when you wish upon a star
your dreams come true

when a star is born
they possess a gift or two
one of them is this
they have the power to make a wish come true

not giving up not giving up
not giving up

selfhatred im fighting
feels like a prison cell
but this story im writing
helps me remind myself
the rock bottom only got me higher
wont be a victim im a survivor
i refuse to believe the liar in my head

the proof is stitched in my scars
im strong enough im strong enough
i found myself through the dark
not giving up not giving up
ive come to understand
that tragedys a second chance
my dying breath is where i was born
now im stronger than my storm

stronger stronger
stronger than my storm
stronger stronger
stronger than my storm

for so long i tried to
prеtend away my pain
my secret to keep it
lеft me one step away
some days i couldnt get much lower
my heart couldnt beat much slower
but i decide when my storys over
storys over storys over

the proof is stitched in my scars
im strong enough im strong enough
i found myself through the dark
not giving up not giving up
ive come to understand
that tragedys a second chance
my dying breath is where i was born
now im stronger than my storm

stronger stronger
stronger than my storm
stronger stronger
stronger than my storm

being broken gave me fight
a semicolon saved my life
i wear my battle scars with pride
being broken gave me fight
and i refuse to be defined
by what i almost did that night

not giving up not giving up
not giving up

the proof is stitched in my scars
im strong enough im strong enough
i found myself fallin so far
not giving up not giving up
ive come to understand
that tragedys a second chance
my dying breath is where i was born
now im stronger than my storm

stronger stronger
stronger than my storm
stronger stronger
stronger than my storm

stronger stronger

qatar 2022
human rights fuck you olé olè olè olè

it feels quite bizarre but the world cup is here
arranged in qatar where its illegal to drink beer
they aint got no stadiums but in the lack of places to play
they hired foreign workers but the workers get no pay

they work fifteen hours a day and they got no place to run
we close our eyes when they collapse under the arabic sun
but there are more important things than a random skinny slave
like a bicycle goal or a match winning peeeenalty saaaave

fifa
nevermind the slavery
fifa
well watch football anyway
fifa
everyone is welcome in qatar
except if youre gay

fifa
nevermind the slavery
fifa
well watch football anyway
fifa
everyone is welcome in qatar
except if youre gay

if a foreign worker tries to run hell be stopped at doha airport
cus when he signed his contract they took his phone and passport
when the thermostat shows forty its important to remember
that fifa has a plan the moved the world cup to december

they work fifteen hours a day and they got no place to run
we close our eyes when they collapse under the arabic sun
but there are more important things than a random skinny slave
like a bicycle goal or a match winning peeeenalty saaaave

fifa
nevermind the slavery
fifa
well watch football anyway
fifa
everyone is welcome in qatar
except if youre gay

we are the bosses of the footbal world fifa does what fifa likes
we gave the cup to a nasty place cuz we got paid by qatari sheiks
friends with sheiks and oligarks infantino saves the day
i got no time for human rights wanna watch my coooountry plaaaaay
wanna watch my country plaaaaay
wanna watch my country play

nevermind the slavery

well watch football anyway

im not a fan of puppeteers but ive a nagging fear
someone else is pulling at the strings
something terrible is going down through the entire town
wreaking anarchy and all it brings

i cant sit idly no i cant move at all
i curse the name the one behind it all

discord im howling at the moon
and sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
discord whatever did we do
to make you take our world away

discord are we your prey alone
or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne
discord we wont take it anymore
so take your tyranny away

im fine with changing status quo but not in letting go
now the world is being torn apart
a terrible catastrophe played by your symphony
what a terrifying work of art

children behave
thats what they say when were together
and watch how you play
they dont understand
and so were

running just as fast as we can
holdin on to one anothers hand
tryin to get away into the night
and then you put your arms around me
and we tumble to the ground
and then you say

i think were alone now
there doesnt seem to be anyone around
i think were alone now
the beating of our hearts is the only sound

look at the way
we gotta hide what were doin
cause what would they say
if they ever knew
and so were

i think were alone now
there doesnt seem to be anyone around
i think were alone now
the beating of our hearts is the only sound
*
all this time
i knew some day youd need to find
something that you left behind
something i cant give you

all these tears
and like a night love disappears
my hearts so good for souvenirs
and memories are forever

all this time
all in all ive no regrets
the sun still shines the sun still sets
and the heart forgives the heart forgets
oh what will i do now with all this time

one more kiss
even though its come to this
ill close my eyes and make a wish
hoping youll remember

all this time
all in all ive no regrets
the sun still shines the sun still sets
and the heart forgives the heart forgets
oh what will i do now with all this time

say goodbye
a bond well make another time
but dont be sorry if you cry
ill be crying too

all this time

all this time
all in all ive no regrets
the sun still shines the sun still sets
and the heart forgives the heart forgets
oh what will i do now with all this time
what will i do now with all this time

chip the glasses and crack the plates
blunt the knives and bend the forks
thats what bilbo baggins hates
smash the bottles and burn the corks
cut the cloth and tread on the fat
pour the milk on the pantry floor
leave the bones on the bedroom mat
splash the wine on every door
dump the crocks in a boiling bowl
pound them up with a thumping pole
and when youve finished if any are whole
send them down the hall to roll
thats what bilbo baggins hates
so carefully carefully with the plates

in a crooked little town
they were lost and never found
fallen leaves fallen leaves fallen leaves on the ground

i hitched a ride until the coast
to leave behind all of my ghosts
searching for something i couldnt find at home

cant get no job can you spare a dime
just one more hit and ill be fine
i swear to god thisll be my one last time

in a crooked little town
they were lost and never found
fallen leaves fallen leaves fallen leaves on the ground
run away before you drown
or the streets will beat you down
fallen leaves fallen leaves fallen leaves on the ground

when it gets dark in pigeon park
voice in my head will soon be fed
by the vultures that circle round the dead

in a crooked little town
they were lost and never found
fallen leaves fallen leaves fallen leaves on the ground
run away before you drown
or the streets will beat you down
fallen leaves fallen leaves fallen leaves on the ground

i never once thought id ever be caught
staring at sidewalks hiding my track marks
i left my best friends or did they just leave me

in a crooked little town
they were lost and never found
fallen leaves fallen leaves fallen leaves on the ground
in a crooked little town
they were lost and never found
fallen leaves fallen leaves fallen leaves on the ground
run away before you drown
or the streets will beat you down
fallen leaves fallen leaves fallen leaves on the ground

run away before you drown
fallen leaves fallen leaves fallen leaves on the ground
run away before you drown
fallen leaves fallen leaves fallen leaves on the ground

dont get me wrong
if im looking kind of dazzled
i see neon lights whenever you walk baby
dont get me wrong
if you say hello
and i take a ride
upon a sea where the mystic moon
is playing havoc with the tide
dont get me wrong

dont get me wrong
if im acting so distracted
im thinking about the fireworks
that go off when you smile

dont get me wrong
if i split like light refracted
im only off to wander
across a moonlit mile
once in a while
two people meet
seemingly for no reason they
just pass on the street
suddenly thunder
showers everywhere
who can explain
the thunder and rain
but theres something in the air

dont get me wrong
if i come and go like fashion
i might be great tomorrow
but hopeless yesterday
dont get me wrong
if i fall in the mode of passion
it might be unbelievable
but lets not say so long
it might just be fantastic
dont get me wrong

a thousand thundering thrills await me
facing insurmountable odds gratefully
the female of the species is more deadly than the male

shock shock horror horror
shock shock horror
ill shout myself hoarse for your supernatural force
the female of the species is more deadly than the male

oh she deals in witchcraft
and one kiss and im zapped

oh how can heaven hold a place for me
when a girl like you has cast a spell on me
oh how can heaven hold a place for me
when a girl like you has cast a spell on me

frankenstein and dracula have nothing on you
jekyll and hyde join the back of the queue
the female of the species is more deadly than the male

oh she wants to conquer the world completely
but first shell conquer me discreetly
the female of the species is more deadly than the male

oh she deals in witchcraft
and one kiss and im zapped

when a girl like you has cast a spell on me

oh ive heard that song about me and i have a few thoughts
cruella de vil
cruella de vil what
if she doesnt scare you
no evil thing will yes
to see her is to
take a sudden chill
cruella cruella de vil

at first you think
cruella is the devil its devill darling
but after time has worn
away the shock gasp
you come to realize
youve seen her kind of eyes
watching you from underneath
a rock well

this vampire bat i wish
this inhuman beast
she ought to be locked up
and never released ha
the world was such
a wholesome place until
cruella cruella de vil

i probably will sue for libel but in the meantime ive made some lyrical improvements listen i was in la la land

cruella de vil
cruella de vil
shes a venus flytrap
youre a daffodil
her killer instinct
is a polished skill
estella er cruella de vil

a villain or not
revolt or despair
nothings black and white
except for her hair
shell change her fortunes
by sheer force of will
look out for cruella de vil

at first you think
cruella is a model oh thank you
but after you have seen
the clothes she makes
youll come to understand
her future will be grand
in life and driving
never hit the brakes

an orphan alone
born brilliant and bad
she loves making trouble
a little bit mad

the world was such
a foolish place until
cruella de vil
i may be odd darling but i always get even

the world was such
an awful place until
cruella cruella cruella cruella de vil
i love animals with fries on the side

the world was such
a boring place until
cruellaaaaaaa oh cruella de vil

a monument to the ruined age
ice in my eyes

screaming at the moon
another past time

everything as cold as life
can no one save you
everything
as cold as silence
and you never say a word

empty mansion in the rain just off the coast

like a spider theres a web that you have wove
theres a heart now where there use to be a ghost

and ooh yeah its making me uneasy

now i hear sounds in the hallway
rocking chairs are moving on their own
im falling for you
so much so that its freaking me out
so much so that its freaking me out
so much so that its freaking me

theres a silence in the woods after it snows
thats the vibe now of the piece inside my soul
like a spider theres a web that you have wove
theres a heart now where there use to be a ghost

and ooh yeah its making me uneasy

rocking chairs are moving on their own
im falling for you
so much so that its freaking me out
so much so that its freaking me out
so much so that its freaking me
sounds in the hallway
rocking chairs are moving on their own
im falling for you
so much so that its freaking me out
so much so that its freaking me out
so much so that its freaking me

do do doo do

sounds in the hallway
rocking chairs are moving on their own
im falling for you
so much so that its freaking me out
so much so that its freaking me out
so much so that its freaking me out
sounds in the hallway
rocking chairs are moving on their own
im falling for you
so much so that its freaking me out
so much so that its freaking me out
so much so that its freaking me

robin hood robin hood riding through the glen
robin hood robin hood with his band of men
feared by the bad loved by the good
robin hood  robin hood  robin hood

he called the greatest archer to a tavern on the green
they vowed to help the people of the king
they handled all the troubles on the english country scene
and still found plenty of time to sing

robin hood robin hood riding through the glen
robin hood robin hood with his band of men
feared by the bad loved by the good
robin hood  robin hood  robin hood

he came to sherwood forest with a feather in his cap
a fighter never looking for a fight
his bow was always ready and he kept his arrow sharp
he used them to fight for what was right

robin hood robin hood riding through the glen
robin hood robin hood with his band of men
feared by the bad loved by the good
robin hood  robin hood  robin hood

with friar tuck and little jhon they had a roguish look
they did the deed the others wouldnt dare
recaptured all the money that the evil sheriff took
and rescued many a lady fair

robin hood robin hood riding through the glen
robin hood robin hood with his band of men
feared by the bad loved by the good
robin hood  robin hood  robin hood

to cheating and corruption he would never never yield
and danger was his breakfast every day
the cobler in the hamlet and the farmer in the field
were always helping him get away

robin hood robin hood riding through the glen
robin hood robin hood with his band of men
feared by the bad loved by the good
robin hood  robin hood  robin hood

he rode up to the palace and cheered by everyone
his lady marian threw him a rose
the king of england knighted him the earl of huntington
and thats the way that the legend goes

robin hood robin hood riding through the glen
robin hood robin hood with his band of men
feared by the bad loved by the good
robin hood  robin hood  robin hood

i hold myself in contempt

tearing the hair off a black baboons skull
heres a bitch with some four thousand names
vomiting lies through her theremin throat
as some businessmen pick at her brains
pulls back skinny lips
to reveal a proboscis
seems seth brundles at it again
tears pages from spines as she judges the cover
and shamelessly spoils the end

blood vessels drying and curling inside are
unfurling from out of her wrists
well she wrings out a snake and collects all its poison
intending to learn it to hiss
foams at the mouth with a head full of acid
and giving some poor illness the blame
knocking the pieces the fuck off the chessboard
insisting that shes won the game

so all that i see absolute entropy
as the chemical bonds fall apart
well it seems she broke me
but i swear she could not break my heart
she could not break my heart oh lord

makes up excuses for throbbing black bruises
and uses them to her advantage
never came down from her last trip on jesus
disease is her primary language
garbled and gruesome her words so absurd
like a heard of transmissions from apollo 13
no apology i request misery
so no rest till ive
twisted her chest round my knee

so squeal like a trolley wheel cry like a baby
with autism strapped to a ceiling fan
soil your visage with mucus and twisting of features unable to stand
buckle your knees looking up at me
and beg me to spare thee the back of my hand
for the sake of humanity die of your blight
were blessed youre barren as mojave sands

so all that i see absolute entropy
as the chemical bonds fall apart
well it seems she broke me
but i swear she could not break my heart woah
now all that i see absolute entropy
as the chemical bonds fall apart

well it seems she broke me
but i swear she can go fucking die kill yourself
you can go fucking die kill yourself
go fucking die kill yourself
kill yourself and go die ugh

daylight is fading away
a night silhouette in the sky
led lights are flashing in towers
its manhattans magical time

blue moon you saw me standing alone
without a dream in my heart
without a love of my own

blue moon you knew just what i was there for
you heard me saying a prayer for
someone i really do care for

and then suddenly appeared before me
the only one my arms could ever hold
i heard somebody whisper please adore me
but when i looked that moon had turned to gold

blue moon now im no longer alone
without a dream in my heart
without a love of my own
without a love of my own

blue moon

i wanna tell you theres a really good reason
why i came home wasted in the middle of the night
a tiny kingdom at the bottom of the trees
where i was always a winner and i was usually right

oh you can watch it when you get a bit older
but for now in the bad bits i should cover your eyes
she painted pictures with the tips of her fingers
sewing buttons to bambi tying strings to a kite

turning into black and white
underneath the swinging lights
barely awake
but i still got my stripes
cause youre the killer with the colored kite

i wanna tell you theres a really good reason
why i came down easy spinning threads to a throne
a tiny kingdom at the bottom of the trees
where i was always a winner and i was barely alone

turning into black and white
underneath the swinging lights
barely awake
but i still got my stripes
cause youre the killer with the colored kite

tangled up tongue tied
tell me what to do
tangled up tongue tied
tell me what to do

turning into black and white
underneath the swinging lights
barely awake
but i still got my stripes
cause youre the killer with the colored kite

turning into black and white

in all the old familiar places
that this heart of mine embraces
all day and through

in that small cafe
the park across the way
the childrens carousel
the chestnut trees the wishing well

in everything thats light and gay
ill always think of you that way

ill find you in the morning sun
and when the night is new
ill be looking at the moon
but ill be seeing you

ive been watching those drops will with sunlight
ill be spending my time on the side with the grass
ill be thinking about my life and where it all leads

life is a waterfall what goes down comes around and never did we realize
its the way we are i think about the good not the bad
and never did we realize

ill be spending my days always think about my life
if its right or if it ends up wrong now
and ill be looking out left and the right
and i know ive been standing in the middle of a crater

life is a waterfall what goes down comes around and never did we realize
its the way we are i think about the good not the bad
and never did we realize

i dont know these days are gone
theres hair in my heart
i know we cant stop now
ill just keep walking these miles as we go
and i know at the end we start to pretend

i dont know these days in my heart
i know we should stop with the fears that we got now
ill just keep walking these miles as we go
and i know at the end we start to pretend now

i dont know these days are gone
theres hair in my heart

so every single day begins and ends the same
i see them pushing to get on board a crowded train
out of the pouring rain to face another pain
why you so afraid of the other side

its just a big parade its people on display
if one should stumble imagine what the rest would say
theyre making harmless sounds their heads go round and round
why do you stay away from the other side

now you have to believe in me
ill live until the day i die
you have to believe in me
ill live until the day i die

until the day i die

youll see me in the clouds laughing a bit too loud
youll see me crying cause im too crazy to be proud
today ill celebrate tomorrow is too late
ill be out there pushing the boderline

postponing is a crime who knows if i have time
when this is over i hope i never walked the line
so call me immature at least i know im sure
ill be crossing over the boderline

now you have to believe in me
ill live until the day i die
you have to believe in me
ill live until the day i die

until the day i die
have to believe

i hear everybody say that today is the day and
sooner or later my luck is gotta change
well that day is never near if youre living by youre fear
stand up and shout youre alive

until the day i die

now you have to believe in me
ill live until the day i die
you have to believe in me
ill live until the day i die

now you have to believe in me
ill live until the day i die
you have to believe in me
ill live until the day i die

ive shed my blood
and ive been growing weaker
yeah its been tough
but im a gogetter im a seeker

and i begin to wonder
if this will all be worth it
and i start to ask myself
how much longer i can do this

if you run in place
youre going nowhere fast
if you keep running this race
youre gonna finish last

well maybe this is it
and my clock is ticking
but im sticking it out
ive got a head thats spinning
and a heart full of doubt
oh this is no way to live
somethings gotta give

all i can do
is take it one day at a time
im overwhelmed
oh god just give me a sign

i could swear that were cursed
because weve seen the very worst
all these intangible forces
stand in the way and im about to burst

if you run in place
youre going nowhere fast
if you keep running this race
youre gonna finish last

well maybe this is it
and my clock is ticking
but im sticking it out
ive got a head thats spinning
and a heart full of doubt
oh this is no way to live
somethings gotta give

this is not what i envisioned
this does not feel right
this is not what i came here for
its not worth the fight

if you run in place
youre going nowhere fast
if you keep running this race
youre gonna finish last

and my clock is ticking
but im sticking it out
ive got a head thats spinning
and a heart full of doubt
oh this is no way to live
somethings gotta give
somethings gotta give
somethings gotta give
somethings gotta give
somethings gotta give

dont think that i wont try
this is not goodbye

turns out im on my own
i wont let it go

the right and wrong that you pretend to know
the fire in my heart it burns in your shadow
the silver lining it began to rust
and now i get who i can and cannot trust
i wont let it go

you crossed the line
you crossed the line
i wont let it go

take back whats mine

the right and wrong that you pretend to know
the fire in my heart it burns in your shadow
the silver lining it began to rust

and the path ive tried to cut was always clear
why has life become a plan
to put some money in my hand yeah

when the love i really need is stupid cheap

and the love i fought to feel was always free

ive told lies that never came true

with you believing in my innocence

its not that easy bein green
having to spend each day the color of the leaves
when i think it could be nicer bein red or yellow or gold
or something much more colourful like that

its not easy bein green
it seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things
and people tend to pass you over cause youre
not standin out like flashy sparkles on the water
or stars in the sky

but green is the colour of spring
and green can be cool and friendlylike

and green can be big like an ocean
or important like a mountain
or tall like a tree
when green is all there is to be
it could make you wonder why
but why wonder why wonder
i am green and itll do fine
its beautiful
and i think its what i want to be

deep inside the border
children are crying
fighting for food
holding their heads
breaking their bread with a stone

all along the roadside
people are standing
watching the sun
shielding their eyes
brushing the flies from their face

tell me what can you say
tell me who do you blame
like a mirror you see yourself
these people each have a name

all around the township
young men are dying
of hunger and thirst
the well has run dry
the tears from her eye feeds her son

tell me

you can say youre pulling back
we see the pictures everywhere
but what we dont see is whats
going on behind the closed doors
and you dont seem to care

do you expect me to believe you
how can you really think
you can take your horse down to the water
hold a gun at his head
and make him drink

no matter what you say it never gets any better
no matter what you do we never see any change

people living without rights
without their dignity
how loud does one man have to shout
to earn his right to be free

you can keep your toy soldiers
to segregate the black and white
but when the dust settles
and the blood stops running
how do you sleep at night

no matter what you say

what makes you so high and mighty
what makes you so qualified
you can sit there and say
how many have their freedom
but how many more have died

you decide to sit in judgment
trying to play god yourself
someday soon the buck is gonna stop
stop with you and no one else

no matter

ill never let you know i rather let you go

time flies
doors open
away goes the past
its okay

brave faces
staring ahead
some move forward
others play dead

look around
at where you have been
its going down
are you ready

you wanna go
oh oh oh oh
get away
ay ay ay ay

you wanna go
oh oh oh oh
get away
ay ay ay ay

you wanna get away
there is no turning back

out here
the world is yours
to give away
or keep it in joy

a heavy soul
a hard fought victory
nothings the same
as they used to be

decisions
playing tricks in me
follow your heart
it takes a leap

you wanna go
oh oh oh oh
get away
ay ay ay ay

you wanna go
oh oh oh oh
get away
ay ay ay ay

you wanna get away
there is no turning back get away

restless hour
on a lonely street
i do this every night cause i can hardly sleep
i drive alone
to nowhere slow
im searching for the parts of me i know you stole

you slipped away
in the midnight breeze
who knew that with a goodbye kiss
that my heart would freeze
just a shadow
just an echo
just a memory

i dont know what hes got that i dont
i just wanna call you but i wont
i know we moved out
but i never moved on
so i drive all night but still the truth is
none of these streets lead back to you

yeah i drive all night but still the truth is
none of these streets lead back to you

will you think of me
when he makes you laugh
does he capture you the way i could in photographs
should i shut my mouth
and turn out the light
pour out something strong and drink you off tonight

but you slipped away
in the midnight breeze
you knew that with that goodbye kiss that my heart would freeze
in the shadow
in the echo
in the memory

i dont know what hes got that i dont
i just wanna call you but i wont
i know we moved out
but i never moved on
so i drive all night but still the truth is
none of these streets lead back to you
back to you yeah
so i drive all night but still the truth is
none of these streets lead back to you

yeah i drive all night but still the truth is
none of these streets lead back to you

i used to think that love
could never take a hold
spin a line round me
it feels so natural
giving in to you
giving in to my needs

but clearly im not thinking too straight
honest and true
im not really handling this
what else can i do

but surrender
dont be tender
my hearts on the line
dont be tender
dont make me want
what cant be mine

i surrender
dont be tender
my hearts on the line
dont be tender
dont make me want
what cant be mine

its all so bittersweet
your touch lingers on
even after youre gone
theres no escape for me
ill give in to you
give in to my needs

but clearly im not thinking too straight
honest and true
im not really handling this
what else can i do

but surrender
dont be tender
my hearts on the line
dont be tender
dont make me want
what cant be mine

do you miss me baby
do you miss me baby
do you love me baby
enough to let me go

i surrender
dont be tender
my hearts on the line
dont be tender
dont make me want
what cant be mine

do you miss me baby
do you miss me baby
do you love me baby
enough to let me go

beneath my skin

my sanity
cause i wanna feel the thunder

when i gave you my heart
it was not what you wanted
now the walls say your name
and the pictures are haunted

does my ring burn your finger
did my love weigh you down
was the promise too much to keep around

i remember your words
and i cant keep from cryin
i could never believe
that your kisses were lyin

was there somethin from the past
buried in a shallow grave
did you think that it was too far gone to save

please tell me baby
please tell me now
you say that i should just go on
now please tell me how

now its just me and the night
and im so brokenhearted
i just wait in the dark here
for my dearly departed

consume me from the inside out lord
let justice and praise become my embrace
to love you from the inside out

your will above all else my purpose remains
the art of losing myself in bringing you praise

everlasting your light will shine when all else fades
never ending your glory goes beyond all fame
in my heart in my soul lord i give you control
consume me from the inside out lord
let justice and praise become my embrace
to love you from the inside out


everlasting your light will shine when all else fades

and then id rruff and roar some more

i could be another caesar
if i only had the nerve

lion id be brave as a blizzard
tin man id be gentle as a lizzard
scarecrow id be clever as a gizzard

dorothy if the wizard is a wizard who will serve
scarecrow then im sure to get a brain
tin man a heart

her soul is presidential like barack son
yeah she call me goose i call her maverick cause of top gun
they say we annoying they just jealous cause we got love
yeah i got a hot one
she dont want no problem if theres not one
but people come around and try some stupid shit to start one
shell give you the peoples fuckin elbow like the rock son

there is a potion in your lips so sweet id die
there is an ocean in your hips so deep id dive
i hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
yeah i think i got one
and every single little thing about her is so

overwhelming
everything about you is so overwhelming
when i think about you it gets overwhelming
cause everything about you is so overwhelming
come over here and overwhelm me

hey do i impress you
i really like the way you rock a sweatsuit
when you working out
and im just watching how your legs move
they would think that you was like developed in a test tube
you deserve a theme song
you could be the shoulder that i lean on
love it when youre late for work and try to slip your jeans on
you be bumping chili peppers all up in your nissan

there is a potion in your lips so sweet id die

obviously i dont want to infer that being invited onto friday night with wossy isnt wonderfully affirming
and i know i oughta
appreciate the risk you took the bookers who agreed to book a chap who tends to talk about the kind of things that get the bbc
in hot water
and i dont wanna seem greedy
im just saying
id like to be here every week if thats okay
and if youll hear me out
i think ive got a way in which we could do it pretty easily
you can leave all the boring details to me
its a brilliant idea
a truly original concept
no one in britain has ever done anything like it yeah
picture this
imagine if we had

five poofs and two pianos
yeah
its a wicked idea
why settle for a quartet of queers
when theres a possibility of a pentapoofter piano posse here
five poofs and two pianos
yeah
itll be ace
a hundred percent more pianos
and twentyfive percent more gays

i know i know ive seen the problem too
theres a rumour i am straight its true
it hurts to admit it
but im about as bent as wossy himself
or fiddy cent
but ive already thought it through
you know theres preachers in america who reckon they can do
sexuality conversions ive heard them assert
they can cure a man of trouser love and turn him on to skirt
well i dont see why they couldnt pull the same trick in reverse
and wed have

five poofs and two pianos
yeah
its a revolution
and probably the best solution
to the problem youre inevitably having with an even number of homosexuals

yes i know your producers might suspect
that the licensepaying public will object
to the corporation having yet
another homosexual to pay
the daily mail will bring the big guns out
jan moir will be frothing at the mouth
writing further brilliant stuff about
the myth of being both happy and gay

but all that moral indignation
will disappear when they see
those four lovely guys and me
singing in perfect harmony
and all those angry letter writers
like disgusted from the isle of wight and
mad from hull and outraged from leeds
and slightly annoyed from berwickontweed
will instantly change their tune
theyll be bleeding heart liberals by saturday noon
theyll be giving their grandchildren up for adoption
in the hope that a gay married couple will adopt them
theyll be putting rainbow stickers on their cars
and cutting holes in the arse of their leather strides

watching two pianos and five guys
watching two pianos and five guys
watching two pianos and five
one two three four

five poofs and two pianos
yeah
itll be grand
you can never have too many pianos
or too much man
five poofs and two pianos
and maybe we could out jamie cullum
make it a trio of pianos
and a big gay halfdozen

im gonna bleed in the club i got weed in my lungs
i dont need any love i cant feel when im drunk
i cant breathe i cant trust i cannot get enough
watch my dreams getting crushed turn my dreams into dust

cold outside and i dont know what to wear
if you go right now i dont know if i would care
i dont get scared but i get nightmares
whats the point of anything if you cant share
i love cold winds cause it tells me where to go
i cant look back and i cannot lose control
find yourself find yourself

im gonna bleed in the club i got weed in my lungs
i dont need any love i cant feel when im drunk
i cant breathe i cant trust i cannot get enough
watch my dreams getting crushed turn my dreams into dust

lost my speed now im slowing down
i cant believe that im lonely now
100 keys and they owe me now
i cannot feel anything inside
i couldnt breathe when you told me why
i want to sleep i dont want to die
admit defeat give away the crown
if we dont speak you cant let me down

once upon a time i used to know a girl
ripped jeans messy hair shinin like a pearl

oh i lost myself tryna have it all
this world feels in a rush and they say they know it all

self love amnesia dont worry if it got you
cause youre not alone not alone
i tried to fight but its getting strong getting strong getting strong
oh i lost myself tryna have it all
self love amnesia dont worry if it got you
cause youre not alone

giving all they want might make you lose control

self love amnesia dont worry if it got you
cause youre not alone not alone
i tried to fight but its getting strong getting strong getting strong
oh i lost myself tryna have it all
self love amnesia dont worry if it got you

self love self love put it back on
oh self love self love youre not alone

i tried to fight but its getting strong getting strong getting strong
oh i lost myself tryna have it all

listen easy
you can hear god calling
walking barefoot by the stream
come on to me
your hairs softly falling
on my face as in a dream
and the time will be our time
and the grass wont pay no mind

saying nothing lying where the sun is
baking down upon our sides
my lips touch you with their soft wet kisses
your hands gentle in reply
and the time will be our time
and the grass wont pay no mind

child touch my soul with your cries
and the music will know what weve found
i hear a hundred goodbyes
but today i hear only one sound
the moment were living is now
now now now now now now now

young bird flying and a soft wind blowing
cools the sweat inside my palms
close my eyes hear the flowers growing
as you lay sleeping in my arms
and the time will be our time
and the grass wont pay no mind
no the grass wont pay no mind

hello so you are my miracle
where are your eyes to look into
how are you ive been longing for you
where is your mouth to question why

dont leave your words bring them with you now
youre still in charge of what you felt
no one can tell you how to finish your
love that was so easy to start

hello my dearest one miracle
you are capricious and unkind
youre always hiding in back of fate
now is the time to do your job

like no one can measure the size of the sea
youll never to notice how far my soul goes with you

hello if you are my miracle
where are your eyes to look into
where are your tears running from

i will let you go i will let you go
i wont say goodbye i wont look behind
i will just leave my deepest sorrows behind
as big as all of the joy we raise together
*
it was raining dark and stormy
nobody was around to warn me
when the chill first went up my spine

swallowed by the great big bad i
cut my way outside him that night
hes the one who taught me how to bite

here come the wolves
coming to get ya
i run through the woods
im not gonna let you go
im baring my teeth im ready
my tongue is a sharp machete
so why do i feel unsteady

you can run run run little lamb
and its not not not who i am
but im a wolf now
guess im a wolf now

my vision has been distorting
i feel my dna transforming
every time i go out in the night

when you think your wounds are greater
a victim can be perpetrator
does the name of justice justify

here come the wolves
coming to get ya
i run through the woods
im not gonna let you go
im baring my teeth im ready
my tongue is a sharp machete
so why do i feel unsteady

you can run run run little lamb
and its not not not who i am
but im a wolf now
guess im a wolf now
so i run run out for some blood
and i hate this but push came to shove
so im a wolf now im a wolf now
guess im a wolf now im a wolf now

here come the wolves
here come the wolves
here come the wolves

im dress from gua pei
i came to find the brightest star like betelgeuse
and i found her i swear i found her
number one star
always number one and im no lie
my boy is driving a tesla cybertruck
on the freeway along the night roads
i circled with him on the dance floor in a star kaleidoscope
hes a space guy
in his brown eyes you will sink like an ocean
as bright as the star rigil

many people dream of being like him
forget he is the smartest guy
born in south africa in the city of pretoria
the guy who reached the top from scratch
now he is number one on the forbes list
elon musk is the richest man on the planet
you cant reach the heights he reached
his shares are growing every day
today a billion dollars tomorrow a trillion dollars
his capital is as fast as his rockets
how do you like this account how do you like these numbers
but youre stuck in the past
and he ahead of the game

he is always full of new ideas and challenges
will always profitably sell his new idea and increase capital
he spends most of his time at work in los angeles
created the richest and most powerful tesla company
tesla electric vehicles lead the world
dont argue with me hes like space
mysterious and with new galaxies
the most famous scientist of our time
tesla electric plane is the best
the godfather of paypal which do you use every day
isnt he genius i think its so genius

elon musk will always be relevant and in the first lines of news
launched the starlink satellite
shares soared to a trillion can you do that
bought twitter shares for 44 billion but will buy it all soon
in a few years he colonizes mars
and its not a lie
spacex is a successful project and you keep dreaming
if you are the brightest star
then ill be the galaxy so you can shine even brighter

though it hurts you must learn to try
i know ive got to let you go
but i know anywhere you go
youll never be far
coz like the light of a bright star
youll keep shining in my life
youre gonna be right

here in my heart
thats where youll be
youll be with me

no distance can keep us apart
long as youre here in my heart

wont be any tears falling from those eyes
cos when true love never dies
it says alive forever
time cant take away what we have
i will remember our time together
you may think our time is through
but ill still have you

here in my heart
i know youll be back again
and till then
my love is waiting

here in my heart
*
the flowers you gave me
are just about to die
when i think about
what couldve been
it makes me want to cry

the sweet words you whispered
didnt mean a thing
i guess our song is over
as we begin to sing


couldve been so beautiful
couldve been so right
couldve been my lover
every day of my life
couldve been so beautiful
couldve been so right
ill never hold what couldve been
on a cold and lonely night

the memories of our lovin
still linger in the air
like the faded scent of your roses
they stay with me everywhere

everytime i get my hopes up
they always seem to fall
still what couldve been is better than
what could never be at all

repeat

how could i hold what couldve been
on a cold and lonely night
*
you took me wrong just because we kissed
and now i dont know how to say goodbye
i know its wrong when youre holding me like this
still wont you stay let me love you for awhile
you know im not that strong when i see you smile

cant you see
this is all a big mistake
i should try and walk away
but i need someone to hold me
and i know theres no way that this can last
still i know that if you ask me to
i know i would stay
tonight just for tonight

you look at me and you dont understand
you know im not the one that could feel your dreams
i cant believe that this is how i am
still wont you stay let me love you for awhile
you know im not that strong when i see you smile

cant you see
this is all a big mistake
i should try and walk away
but i need someone to hold me
and i know theres no way that this can last
still i know that if you ask me to
i know i would stay
tonight

i love the way you watch me
i love you the way we move
but in my heart i know
ill never be in love with you

cant you see

cant you see
this is all a big mistake
i should try and walk away
but i need someone to hold me
and i know theres no way that this can last
still i know that if you ask me to
i know i would stay
tonight just for tonight
*
if there was no tomorrow
then tonight would never end
if we could freeze the hands of time
i would stay here in your arms
and not go back again

cause all i want
is for you to hold me now
and we can make it through
this night together

and all i need
is for you to show me how
cause nothing can stop
this feeling of forever

ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh

ive never felt this close enough
lying here face to face
far beneath the silver sky
and theres no one around
to chase this night away



the world is ours tonight
as long as we just believe
the feelings that we hold inside are
in every heart that beats
and these feelings of forever
oh


*
too good together to be
so apart these days
and now more than ever
we need to talk face to face
we stopped moving forward
and now were some place else
but the more we fool each other
the less we fool ourselves

cause our hearts never lie
they just feel the love
try so hard to deny
theres no reason to act
like we dont care
when the truth is always there
oh hearts never lie
why should we

this whole thing is crazy
building walls to keep out the pain
when theres no changing
mistakes already made
so lets start all over
one emotion at a time
beginning with this feeling
that weve never lost inside



does the word love scare you away
does forever seem too long to stay
now its time we end this nowhere charade
and a real good place to start
is to listen to your heart


*
all up and above
i keep going round and round
on top of the highland
a long way down

another of me
two worlds apart
i wish i could reach for me
the other side

within a dream
losing my thoughts around you
and all the things we used to do

was it the dream
if i would stay or walked away
*
we stay jaded
just gotta face it
its burning out oh
keep breaking my heart
like youve just got a way
we could drive away

please dont let me down
we could drive away

we stay jaded
just gotta face it
its burning out oh
keep breaking my heart
like youve just got a way
oh ill fight you through time and space

we could drive on

please dont let me down
*
touch you right now

i was the one who had it all
i was the master of my fate
i never needed anybody in my life
i learned the truth too late
ill never shake away the pain
i close my eyes but shes still there
i let her steal into my melancholy heart
its more than i can bear

now i know shell never leave me
even as she runs away
she will still torment me
calm me hurt me
move me come what may
wasting in my lonely tower
waiting by an open door
ill fool myself shell walk right in
and be with me for evermore

i rage against the trials of love
i curse the fading of the light
though shes already flown so far beyond my reach
shes never out of sight

now i know shell never leave me
even as she fades from view
she will still inspire me
be a part of everything i do
wasting in my lonely tower
waiting by an open door
ill fool myself shell walk right in
and as the long long nights begin
ill think of all that might have been
waiting here for evermore

i never used to cry cause i was all alone
for me myself and i is all ive ever known
i never felt the need to have a hand to hold
in everything i do i take complete control
thats where im coming from
my lucky numbers one

ive everthing i need to keep me satisfied
theres nothing you can do to make me change my mind
im having so much fun
my lucky numbers one
ah oh ah oh

ay ay ay ay ay
i now detect an alien vibration here
theres something in the air besides the atmosphere
the object of the action is becoming clear
an imminent attack upon my heart i fear
the evidence is strong
my lucky numbers rung
ah oh ah oh

something tells me my lucky numbers gonna be changing soon
something tells me lucky numbers gonna be

you certainly do have a strange effect on me
i never thought that i could feel the way i feel
theres something in your eyes gives me a wild idea
i never want to be apart from you my dear
i guess it must be true
my lucky numbers two

this rearrangement suits me now i must confess
the number one was dull and number two is best
i wanna stay with you
my lucky numbers two
ah oh ah oh

number
number
number
number
number

when i gave you my heart
it was not what you wanted
now the walls say your name
and the pictures are haunted

does my ring burn your finger
did my love weigh you down
was a promise too much to keep around

i remember your words
and i cant keep from cryin
i could never believe
that your kisses were lyin

was there somethin from the past
buried in a shallow grave
did you think it was too far gone to save

please tell me baby
please tell me now
you say that i should just go on
now please tell me how

now its just me and the night
and im so brokenhearted
i just wait in the dark here
for my dearly departed

did my ring burn your finger
did my love weigh you down
was a promise too much to keep around

if i had to lose a mile
if i had to touch feelings
i would lose my soul
the way i do

i dont have to think
i only have to do it
the results are always perfect
and thats old news

would you like to hear my voice
sprinkled with emotion
invented at your birth

i cant see the end of me
my whole expanse i cannot see
i formulate infinity
stored deep inside me

if i had to touch feelings
i would lose my soul
the way i do

they say im crazy
but the whole world has gone mad
they think im dangerous
i might agree with that

when everything i touch will break
loving you is my escape
so come on give me what i crave

i want it
i want it
do you want it

i scare myself
with the way that i need you
theres no one else
tell me that you can feel it too
id crawl through hell
if it meant i could keep you
i scare myself

i come unraveled
when you whisper my name
my head is spinning
you make me feel insane

the moment that our skin collides
theres nothing left for me to hide
i have finally learned to fly

and i want it
i want it
do you want it

i scare myself
with the way that i need you
theres no one else
tell me that you can feel it too
id crawl through hell
if it meant i could keep you
i scare myself

when everything i touch will break
loving you is my escape
so come on give me what i crave

i want it
i want it
do you want it

i scare myself
with the way that i need you
theres no one else

id crawl through hell
if it meant i could keep you

trying to finish my thoughts
but the anger takes me to another world
or a another side
yeah ive been frustrated lately lately
my frustration is a sign that i have sides
ive won ive lost
ive lied ive come into grips with stuff
but my sides is nothing ive agreed on

frustration please dont hold me back
if you do ill put a pin on you

happiness is living the life
anger just makes me a strikе

ive won ive lost
ive lied ive come into grips with stuff
but my sides is nothing ive agreed on
