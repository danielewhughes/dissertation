rise up ye stalwart men
and put the pitch alight on your torch sticks
vanquish those who would do us evil
and establish the rule of france
and oh woman of the house what ails you
oh woman of the house in two years or three
from this year out the land will be rent free
oh woman of the house
oh woman of the house isnt that pleasant
heres a jug on the table and the beers coming
and the duke of york has sufficient arms
the french and the spaniards at the shores edge
and how bitter that is than womans chatter
from sat down and my desire to mais
drinking my charter will i drink like a man
he said the woman of the house of gentle conversation
without airigead be shot down out
since i pulled up my piece bracket
woe i was not without my ruin
she was again a cry charitable
do not you sit down you are all entertainment
alas and alack when i was young
two years old and no evil thought in my mind
that i didnt join the kings navy or army
instead of spending my life looking after you

your mouth was sweeter to me
than the cuckoos singing
and its you that has left me at deaths door
i am so grieved
i couldnt keep her
they said i was one
who deceives women
you have killed me forever
you have greatly weakened me
and all thats alive to me
you broke my heart
her golden trident with her down a foot
and them being piled on each side
you have killed me forever
you have greatly weakened me
and all thats alive to me
you broke my heart
one day i was musically in the road
i met the quiet young woman

my darling love will you come back home
my darling love will you come with me
my darling love will you come back home
my darling love
he was down at the market
he drank and sang all day long
when night came and he hadnt a penny in his pocket
oh what a shame i didnt take the missus advice
i met him at sunrise
a charming healthy and lively young lad
when he lifted his hat and spoke with a smile
i fell in love with him thought it would never end
my coat had buttons of silver
and the best silk ribbons in the country
golden chains and precious stones
i truly enticed him with my glitter and gold
no one knew from which part of the land he came
he spoke nobly and with pleasant ease
rumor had it that there was a lord in his family
it wasnt long til i was engaged to him
the bond is long and difficult to untie
its much better to be sure of it
it didnt take long til he broke my heart
indeed this is not the story id prefer to be telling
but then he went back down to the market
and bought a ticket for a pound or two
luck was on his side he won the lottery
now well forever be living the good life

oh young man of the flowing hair on which side are you
are you without a companion and are you lying alone
oh i am without a companion and i am lying alone
who is that girl whos asking is it anyone alive from the country
it seems you do not recognize myself the dearest of your heart
while i am your quite flowing girl who used to be by your side during the night
i do not recognize you while there is no piece of your beauty left
thats how the clay spoiled me ray of sunlight and of wind
when my people suppose i am on my bed
on your tomb i am from evening till morning
imagining i am down there with you and eternally weeping my sorrow
after my quite prudent girl who used to pledge herself to me as a child
my family has been dealing with me brothers and priests
about me being in love with you mary now when you are dead
you were a shadow from the bad weather and a shelter from rain
my sun of the winter day and now you are down below the ground
*
if youd come with me to county liatrom
o brownhaired flower of maidens
id give you honey and mead for food
o brownhaired flower of maidens
bright salmon id bring back to you
wine and beer to drink after that
you could sleep sound in a bed of down
o brownhaired flower of maidens
oh i saw her toward me through the mountains
like a star approaching in the mist
and i was talking and conversing with her
till we reached the cows pasture
we sat down beside the road
and i swore to her in writing
that nothing she lacked but id rove out to find
for the brownhaired flower of maidens
ah ill not go with you
and its no good your asking
said the brownhaired flower of maidens
for your speeches wont keep me alive without food
said the brownhaired flower of maidens
a thousand times better that i were single forever
than to be walking the dewy glens with you
and that my heart gave you love and affection
said the brownhaired flower of maidens
*
no heart hangs
my eyes long for you
on distant water
i gave in
what enchantment lies
you are my desire
in this world
my eyes long for you
i gave in
you are my desire
you are my desire
i wander westward my heart desires
with seas alive
shadow me under the mountains of time
guide me to endless paths
no tear falls
my eyes long for you
on stony highways
i gave in
that skyline splendor
you are my desire
lights my life
we wander westward our hearts desire
with seas of light
shadow us under the mountains of time
guide us to endless paths

music of the waves is beating loud tonight
she hears only whispers
rustling babbled conversation

flying in at half past eight
a bright moon shining down
to guide her to her destination

i asked advice from an old man along the way
hoping to get some gentle
helpful words from ancient times

and he said to me with sparkling eyes
look son
thats right there in front of you
days are long and lonely
till youll be forever with me
theres nothing you could say
thatll keep my love from me anymore
rainbows in the sky all over africa
come away now to do things
we didnt have an opportunity to do
a wild hound crying languidly in the night
theyre sad  lonely far from them
a little comfort  raised spirits

like olympus over the serengeti

im a herdsmans daughter sure enough
who once lived down by the banks of the laune
i had a cabin there a window in the gable
while i heated the milk i called in the calves
aililiú the calves the pretty calves
aililiú the calves i loved them the best
aililiú the calves the fine pretty calves
dancing in the meadow on a clear summers morning
get me a can and get me a ladle
get me a vessel to take all the cream
the magic music of the world always around me
but sweeter sounding still the cattle lowing to the parlor
let us go to the fair and buy us some calves
put them to grass out above in the valleys
theyll eat all the grass and the tufts of the strange gorse
and come home for the milk at the start of the summer

angels we have heard on high
sweetly singing oer the plains
and the mountains in reply
echoing their joyous strains
gloria in excelsis deo

shepherds why this jubilee
why your joyous strains prolong
what the gladsome tidings be
which inspire your heavnly song
come to bethlehem and see
him whose birth the angels sing
come adore on bended knee
christ the lord the newborn king
see him in a manger laid
whom the angels praise above
mary joseph lend your aid
while we raise our hearts in love

i wish i were in ardicoan
near yon mountain far away
i would seldom let the sunday go
from the cuckoos glen across the bay
it is many a christmas day i had
in cushendun while still a lad
hurling on the white shore strand
with my good ash hurley in my hand
and its oh dear ireland youre my home
far from you i had to roam
and my heart is heavy and alone
but my heart is weary all alone
and it sends a lonely cry
to the land that sings beyond my dreams
and the lonely sundays pass me by
but the grave is waiting for us all
the whole wide world must heed its call
it steals the mother from her brood
as it stole away my boyhood
if i only had a boat and oar
i would row to erins shore
trusting god to see me oer
and the lonely sundays pass me by
in time to die in ireland

there is only one thing i want
thats to hear you on the phone
if i could see you one more time
i could die without a care
when you said goodbye without a care
i died a little bit inside
my heart fell deeper and deeper into darkness
alone without you beside me
because did you love me my love my dear
why did you leave
why did you leave
the only thing i want the only thing i want is
someone someone
like youuuu ó  ú
i remember that hollow day
you took my soul and destroyed me
but now im only praying
that you will give me back my heart

whats going on in your head
trying to speak with you but i cant
i lost my rhythm and i falling
tormented by the sound
i fell down with no reason or rhyme
caught in your spell the one magic every day
im so enraptured it breaks my heart
but ill be fine
my heads under water
but im not drowning
crazy and i have to say
im always thinking of you
with your big blue eyes
and your beautiful perfect hair
give me memories
and ill come to you
at your start and at my end
i cant wait for you anymore
you are the love of my heart

tomorrow is st patricks day
the first day of the session
its a hard cold day
colder than fate
the testimonies are against me
and a lot of them proven
and the commander of the authorities
has said that i am to hang
dear brother
take home my hat
my stockings my shoes
and my brown coloured coat
tell my mother
whos been in bed for a season
that i shall wear the narrow hempen rope
in place of a necktie
my hurley and ball
are next to my bed
and i would hit a stroke
as high as the moon
my swift little stallion
is on the hill at home
but my name will be in the papers
in clonmel tomorrow
isnt it a pity that im not a fisherman
on the banks of baile an tsléibhe
or in a lovely feathery swan
on lough erne
my name is james murphy
the best man in ireland
the man who wont be seen
in this gathering until judgement day
*
ill get up in the morning
in the name of sunday
and i will take up residence
on the little fair hill
oh i will build a house there
beside the road
at easy reach
to all places
there ill have the freedom
of the roads
where i will meet learned people
of ships and boats
there will be a school for artists
and for the young
seeking knowledge
at my door
it is the talk of old women
and wise old folk
that has my mind confused
and my head spinning
saying that the pooka was there
since the time of the flood
that people saw him
but no one can tell when
it is not that i would want
as winter approaches
to have my front garden
turned upside down
at night he is
a cat or a dog
and as soon as he is a pooka
he turns into an old white gelding
if i had a horse
as fast as the pooka
my soul would be fast moving
getting there and coming back
if he loaded his cargo
way down at ceann gaineamh
oh hed be at eamonn obriens gable
within the halfhour
i will raise a fence
by leenanes ledge
to stop him getting in
by torc moore slope
if he approaches cashel
through the center of maoine
over to the sheepland
or over by the green pasture
i wont let him pass by me
over land or sea
and ill keep a close eye on him
on the roadway
if he happens on jack
a man of renown
he will surely put
his nose out of joint
*
if i were three leagues out at sea
or in the mountains far from the land
is no living thing to accompany me there
but fern green and heather
the snow being blown down on me
is the wind clearing it off me
i am having a conversation with my fair taimín
and the night would not feel so long
dear mary what shall i do
this winter is getting cold
dear mary what will this house do
and those who are in it
were you not young my dear
when you went away during the good times
in the times when the cuckoo sang its song
and all the green foliage was growing
if my children are in my home
the night when i die
they will hold my wake lovingly
for three nights and three days
therell be lovely clay pipes for me
and wellfilled kegs
therell be three young women from the mountains
to keen for me on the boards
and cut my coffin out for me
from topnotch bright boards
if seán ó heidhin is in muighinis
have it made by his hand
let my cap with my ribbon in it
be in there placed prettily on my head
have paidín mór bring me to muighinis
or the day will go wrong
as im going west past sandy isle
let the flag be on the mast
dont put me in letir caladh
as my people are not there
but carry me west to muighinis
where theyll mourn me loudly
therell be light on the sandhills
ill not suffer lonliness there

between the here between the now
between the north between the south

where the air is nice and fresh
oh it would be a lot nicer with you dear
when im gone

youll miss me when im not there
youll miss me and my talking
youll miss me and my playing

by valentia harbour i happened once
near sweet goleen dairbhre
where ships set sail
for the ocean deep
to be the master in portmagee
soon all had the sorrowful story then
of the sturdy craft lost at owen finn
sad was my heart for the ship that failed
better this land had it survived the gale
*
once while making a tour in haste
to view all the sights so fair
by the northern isles i was bound
like a deer being pursued by hounds
said the people who stood by the bay
when i arrived on the pier
it shows from the grief on your face
youre a man who is haunted by fear
a handsome young girl i met
whose sharp words cut me to the core
if youre the one who has harmed a young maid
your actions i do deplore
on the mainland i saw a young man
who was fleeing barefooted in awe
im thinking that youre the young man
that is closely pursued by law
i answered this pretty young maid
as she seemed to take heed of my tale
stop now from speaking in jest
im not one of the type you claim
but come and sit closer to me
and act just the same as i
or ill go straight and leave you in grief
and reach the mainland with one leap
our talk became lonely and sad
and this young maiden said to me
where could a strong glass be had
that would rid us of all our woes
theres an alehouse alongside the road
where theres always a glass to spare
you go now and rap on the board
and it wont cost you the fare
the drink flowed freely galore
was the popular brew in the land
and if i drank odonnells gallon
my store would be taken in hand
*
have you seen my little jimmy
my little love my little boy
have you seen my little jimmy
as he was going down the road
no shoes at all on his little feet
on his little feet on his little feet
no shoes at all on his little feet
nor a little hat or coat
going to school is little jimmy
my little love my little boy
going to school is little jimmy
a little yellow book in his pocket
on his back is a little bag
a little bag a little bag
on his back is a little bag
and his little lunch inside it
he was born in móin a lín
at the bottom of the hill in a little bird nest
he was born in móin a lín
near to bun dóite
the love of my heart is my little jimmy
my little love my little boy
the love of my heart is my little jimmy
from morning till night

on sunday morning before hearing mass
there was merry company in neilí héalys pub
there was banging on tables
and drink was being called for
she was there and she didnt drink a drop
fal do deal do deigh ró fal do deal do dé ró
fal do deigh dileigh dí dileigh dí dé ró
fal do deal do deigh ró fal do deal do dé ró
fal do deigh dileigh dí dileigh dilí dil é ró
when i came home from attending mass
i walked beside her making excuses to her
but the woman of the house came
and she all redfaced
and she threw out the airy girl away from me
oh mary twomey dont condemn me
if im very fond of the airy girl
i wouldnt drink a drop of the frothy can
and id walk the roughty with her
and i promise she wouldnt be in danger
if id ever see her on a street or at a fair
id have a can and a quart in my hand with her
i wouldnt join in shaming or condemning her
because shed dance on the boards with me
to the delight of ireland
and the advice i give to young girls
dont stay out late
in the company of young men
but come home early in the evening
or unless you do the road will be the allait
*
theres a beautiful girl whom i gave my love
she is kinder and lovelier than a flower or rose
without her hand in mine im weak
o beautiful girl youre the cause of my grief
o beautiful girl whom i gave my love
give me your hand my dearest one
tell me that youre my bright love
and there will be happiness upon me instead of sorrow
when i rise lonely
that is the time my sorrow is greatest
i think of the precious girl
who is far from me my ruin and my grief
if you came to me beautiful girl
ever again i wouldnt be sad
i would play music for you like music of the harp
or the sweet song of the thrush in the fogs bright dew
*
the pretty young girl on a popular i
my heartache mhaidne sorry i do not meet her
when i go to the drinking house to dance or sports
butd follow her trail on the average night time 
as you are the young man enough shiúlfas
get me a jewel to me as a woman who
do santaigh forever property of sheep or cow
ill charm you like it
young friendly either indifferently or grief
smart enough for all sheort not
tuicsneach very nice without too much pride
while my darling if she had not a penny
have a spotless reputation in the in capacity
a clean heart and a gentle demeanor
without gangaid or grain in their mouth words
the smile on her face from her morning to night
ill charm you like it

id love to be
on a sloping hillside
with an irish girl
by my side
id coax and tease her
and draw her nearer
no happier state
can i visualize
as i rode out
when day was dawning
to herd the kine
by the leafy glade
i espied a damsel
on the pasture seated
with hazel nuts
in her mantle tied
i gently spoke
to this pretty maiden
and would like to kiss her
if shed agree
she answered softly
and spoke in english
and uttered pray sir and let me be
the herds deserve
to be craved and cared for
and i would herd them
the live long day
they give fresh milk
and churning through the summer
and for stocks of kine sure
young maidens wed
*
isnt it hard for me to praise my redhaired girl
not only because of her red hair
she was like a ray of sun reflected through glass
and she had the beauty of the finne women
i took her from town to town
from the gates of derry to athlone
theres not a mile of the way i traveled
that i didnt give my redhaired girl a drink of ale
i prefer her to any cow or heifer
or all the long ships drawing into the harbor
i would rather than have all the rent of clonmel
to be in athlone with my redhaired girl
i sent my girl to the sligo market
that was the market that was expensive
a weight of butter cost one guinea
and i gave it willingly to my redhaired girl
she went west wearing striped shoes
her hair tied up with the greenest ribbons
she left me for a shopboy
god wasnt she lovely my redhaired girl
*
i wandered down from the top of the reek
down to you over at sliabh bán
in search of the girl who left my mind troubled
and who turned my heart as black as coal
my shoulders swelled up to my ears
and i received a clear sharp warning from death
and there wasnt one who heard my story
who didnt say that hed pity the caisideach bán
at the top of the stairs is the flower of all maidens
shes the lighthearted fairbreasted plesant young girl
its a pity that she without cattle or money
accountable to noone cant give me her hand
id build her a big house there by the roadside
and provide carriages for her family
o amber locks if you would milk my cows for me
how youd tie the sheaves in autumn would worry me not
and isnt it strange how you tried to convince
the grass couldnt grow up through the ground
that the moon wouldnt throw her light on ireland
that the stars wouldnt shine at the start of the night
theres neither strength nor vigour in the heat of the sun
and until fish swim in a dried up ocean
till floods rise up as high as the mountains
ill never desert you love of my heart
and i spent a while learning english
and the clergy said that i spoke it well
and as long again without an ounce of sense
no more than the birds on the tops of the trees
out at night without shelter or refuge
and the snow driving down to the bottom of the glen
and o pretty brown locks for whom i left holy orders
may you not get gods grace if you dont come with me
and i was at college till the time i was shaven
and in the high school for five years
education and counsel i received from the church
but alas i paid no heed
i greatly fear the king of graces
that i am not to be set free
because my sins are as great as half of croagh patrick
because of the love i gave to a bailiffs daughter
there she goes past us the beautiful white swan
and she as well adorned as any woman
it is a pity she was conceived in her mothers womb
it was for my death that she was born
there is neither hill nor rushy hollow
no beautiful glen where my love is
that music is not played by day and by night
and may christ have mercy on the caisideach bán
a false vision i saw last night
and i was alone on a bed of down
the beautiful lady lay down alongside me
she was so pretty with the most beautiful eyes
she had a smooth chalkwhite waist like flickering candles
and her hair flowed down so thickly to the grass
her complexion was brighter than the mountainsides snow
it was she who killed me and with me hundreds more
a false vision i saw last night
and it startled me from the depths of my sleep
that the nice kind maiden of the bright firm breasts
lay herself down by my side
as i turned around quickly and swiftly
to catch her tresses who was so thin and so firm
all i found was the edge of the blanket
and that has left me bereft for life

do you remember that night
you were at the window
without a hat without gloves
for your shelter without a coat
i stretched out my hand to you
and you gave it a squeeze
and i stayed in your company
until the lark spoke
do you remember that night
that you and i
at the bottom of the rowan tree
and the night freezing
your head on my breasts
and your merry pipe aplaying
its little i thought that night
that our wooing would be broken up
o love of my innermost heart
come some night soon
when my people are asleep
for us to talk together
my two arms will be around you
and me telling you my news
and it was your merry smooth gentle conversation
that robbed me of the sight of gods heaven
the fire is unraked
the light is unextinguished
the key is under the door
and pull it quietly
my mother is asleep
and im wide awake
my fortune is in my hand
and me ready to walk with you

i drink tea and i drink punch
and the following day i drink toddy
im only drunk but once a month
thanks for charity and from anybody
everyone considers all lifes ways
thinks of the clergy thinks of buying
thinks of the army its power and sway
but sure charity is the trade im trying
some farmed land now i see
the golden meadow and lambing sheep
theres a driving rain and a cutting breeze
never a threat to my crops for none i keep
now under the sun im happy still
never a care in the world just joy replayed
no tax nor worry but my own free will
charity sure beats craft or trade
if one day im cursed with drought
the following day ill be ordering toddy
one day with wine the next without
thanks for charity and from anybody

oh my wren
oh my wren
eaten by the cat
blood on its snout
and im left with only a little bone
eaten by the cat
blood on its snout
and im left with only a little bone
dúidín dáidín
the nice little thing that i lost
may the god of grace allow
me to get him again
a little story about my wren
i gave her a drop of milk
when the cat struck her
she fell down from a hight
whatever strange misfortune
that compelled her to travel
who would believe it possible for her to die
and i standing beside her
like a kind of magnet
its amazing to me
the way she left
and jumped towards me
what is rare is wonderful
as he jumped like lightning
he gave her a swipe with his claw
and she didnt know any better
sweet silence from the little bird
shes just the size of my little finger
as if there was a god of the little birds
she is gone up to heaven
thats the end of my story
a little story about my wren
the way the cat ate her
and he left me nothing but bone

listen to sweet music of the sea
as you walk alone on an empty shore
listen to sweet music of the sea
as you walk alone on an empty shore
the place you felt tranquility
the place you felt calmness
listening to the tide out and in
the noise of the wind living hope
let your eyes extend to the horizon
look now there is solace in my heart
look out on the sea
without exchange of advice on the white beach
the place you see the bluegreen of the water
the place you see the waves dance before you
listen to the sweet music of the sea
hasten yourself in the morning
the place you feel the power of the sunset
the place you feel the magic of the end of the day
listen to the sweet music of the sea

in the old glen yonder she was always
until the horns grew on her
a year and a hundred and some days
until age came heavily to her
she was in a small pen in the fog 
until st johns day  came and she escaped
down the road through the big gap
until she was hotly pursued
noone was after her except young donnchú
and she ate his lunch
he only had in his fist a 
and he brought it down from the 
when the white goat heard that she was 
she leapt for freedom 
she gave a race and she wasnt satisfied
and she knocked down the thorn  of the tailor
as smart as a seal that she took meat
without peas or without much 
but she ate sedge and the top of the heather
and small branches
and briars and green
everything with the color of
mountain feast leaves
sheep and
she went the rent payment of caiftin spits
and her heart that they would abandon her
she spent the night on little food
grass
she spent the night at the bottom of ros coill
and she spent it happily
until the crowd came early in the morning
and took her out from ireland

helped by a good year
my suit of clothes was fine
it was with a light and joyous nature
that i deceived women
but i desired an untidy woman
since a couple of cows were her dowry
and she left me in hardship
and my fair skin without a shirt
if you wore a good suit at that time
maybe it wasnt your own
you were not married a week
when the neighbor man came calling
you sold my goods
that and indeed more
you left me in poverty
and without a stitch on me at night
my lads my lads
those of you who are unmarried
dont lust after the untidy women
according to how they are fixed up
better for you a clean girl
who will constantly sweep
not just clean out the weeks
horrid dirt on sunday
helped by a good year
my suit of clothes was fine

going down the glen yesterday afternoon
the shadow cleared from the foot of the mountain
the dew lying on the top of the grass
all the world asleep
the shadow cleared from the foot of the mountain
no danger at all til morning
the mystery of this land
from generation to generation
a place like a dream vision in the fog
a quiet secret
the power of the trees there
inspired the bards to their poetry
the stones that are blessed under the heavens
down by glendalough
in a well in a fort
the hospitality of colmcille
will be until judgment day
going down the glen yesterday afternoon
the shadow cleared from the foot of the mountain
the dew lying on the top of the grass
all the world asleep
the shadow cleared from the foot of the mountain
the dew lying on the top of the grass
the shadow cleared from the foot of the mountain
no danger at all til morning

as i set out with me pike in hand
to dromore town to join a meithil
who should i meet but a tan puck goat
and hes roaring mad in ferocious mettle
aillillu puilliliu  aillillu its the mad puck goat
aillillu puilliliu  aillillu its the mad puck goat
he chased me over bush and weed
and thru the bog the running proceeded
til he caught his horns in a clump of gorse
and on his back i jumped unheeded
he did not leave a rock that had a passage through
which he did not run with force to destroy me
and then he gave the greatest leap
to the big slope of faille bríce
when the sergeant stood in rochestown
with a force of guards to apprehend us
the goat he tore his trousers down
and made rags of his breeches and new suspenders
in dingle town the next afternoon
the parish priest addressed the meeting
and swore it was the devil himself
hed seen riding on the poc ar buile

at the wedding which was in cana the god of graces was there in person
himself and mary his mother and wasnt the marriage beautiful
companies were laid out there and in want of wine
but the water in the vessels wasnt it beautiful to taste
o bright god o jesus o bright king of the earth
who bore the crown of thorns and the sacrifice of the cross
torn and flogged among those without friends
you broke the locks which were against us
too fine is the treasure the lord of glory has in store for us
his own blood and body as food for the sinners
dont place your hope in gold or in wealth
because it is a falsehood like mist compared to the glory of heaven

were you on the rock
or did you yourself see my love
or did you see the brightness the fairness
or the beauty of the woman
or did you see the finest apple
that came from the healthiest flower
did you see my valentine
is she being persecuted as they are saying
i was on the rock
and i did see your love
and i saw the brightness the fairness
and the beauty of the woman
and i did see the finest apple

one fine autumn day
as i headed west along this road
i came across a young maiden
as she milked her cow beside the ditch
she was so fair
and her face was like a rose
i wish you would marry me
for you have my heart beguiled
oh its soon enough for us to marry
young man she said to me
for first we should enjoy our youth
and have good fun and spree
come with me to youghal
when the harvest is being saved
and i am young and hearty
for some fun i am prepared
we went into the tavern
where we sat comfortably
wine and brandy were put on the table
and i shared it out
there was plenty on the table
but i had to pay for everything
for he left me there and headed west
with my comb in this pocket
im the sad woman until morning
my young love said she
i will not laugh or be merry
until he returns this way
my hair is falling about me
and theres nothing to style it
since i lost my beautiful comb
that used to be placed high in my hair
hell come this roadway tomorrow
and welcome him heartily
fix a wooden chair for him
in the center of the house
take his hat off his head
and dont feel embarrassed by it
and there youll find my lovely comb
that used to be placed high in my hair

im a lively and versatile wandering man
and supply me with ladies
where in the spring id scatter the seed
twice over the white lands
where in the spring id scatter the seed
twice over the white lands
id have my hands on the plough as i follow the horses
and id split hills open on the slopes
and my five hundred farewells to you my fathers district
and to the beloved island
and to the crowd of young men behind me
at home whod help me in time of need
dublin is burnt away and galway will be taken
well have flames on bonfires
my father will have wine and ale on his table
such a help to the wandering man
and on the first day in ireland that i enlisted
i was tipsy and satisfied
and on the second day i enlisted
i was sadly tormented
but on the third day i enlisted
id have given five hundred pounds to leave
and even if id given that id hardly
have got my pass to leave
and one fine day i was down in galway
and the river was flowing down
the trout and the eel and the pack of sticks
were there and all such fine things
the young women there were polite and gentle
and they were slender amiable and nice
but there wasnt a young woman that i sat with that
i didnt tell her that black was white
and i long for the day id be in a house
without a sweetheart for twelve years and three months
for i am a lively spirited young fellow
and id woo the gentle beauty
and it was twelve women who were envying and contending for me
all hoping to benefit from my spade
it was the prayer of the old woman as i crossed the threshold
now behave your self you wandering man

by midautumn i was spent
my story was a very sad one
sick sorrowful and weary was i
without consolation in life
my little field of grass uncut
on account of the family of brackloon
and the neighbors grass already cut
and dried by the sun
if i had a scythe from england
and a handle from lough leane
a stone and a board and sand on it
from the country of oneill
i would give it an edge in the morning
that would stand for the whole week
and the acre would be cut
by daybreak
i was thinking to myself
at night while i slept
that there were two brave young men
boasting of their sharpness
my message was dispatched to them
to cut my little field for me
and loving welcoming responsive
they both came
ready and sharp they had a scythe
at daybreak
and they leaned cleanly and tidily
into the work of cutting the grass
a little before milking time
and a great part of the day not yet spent
enough of it was cut
and it shaved to the earth
*
i made a decision
and i followed it with certainty
that i could escape my family
over on the new island
i was turning away
from the high king above me
who kept me from every misfortune
which could end my journey
i walked twenty miles
and i didnt meet a soul
a horse a cow or a sheep
grazing in the field
only dense woods and glens
and roaring wild beasts
men and women
in tatters
but i happened into a house
when i met some people
they asked me my name
what land i was from
i told them in english
that i was raised in ireland
by the side of loch éirne
in the woods of lios na raoch
there was an old woman
in the corner knitting socks
she joyfully arose
and shook my hand
bless my soul my countryman
you are truly one of us
i was raised in ireland
in baile lios béal áinetha
i made a decision
and i followed it with certainty
that i would return to ireland
the place where i would be buried
as i might find gentle folk and young folk
who are friendly and delightful
with whom i could spend
the night and the day
*
i have a new story to tell you
its good crack and chat over drink
a fine lovely apple i put in my pocket
and all i found was a seed potato
oh sadly my eyes cry
after that fine yellow apple
and the lovely young woman who gave it to me
and id give a pound to taste it again
i walked clare island and carrig aonor
the bays of béara island were before me on the way
puinte na ngréige and dorsaí maola
the raven and the calf outside of baoi
i walked through cualach because i was sad
the northern parish and eyeries
on the island of muarseadh a young man told me
that i wouldnt get word of her until id tie the knot
i walked through cobh and baile na mona
cathar tún tóime and sherkin is
on the east coast someone told me
that it was the laughing stock of néidín

we ultimately
there is nothing there to discuss
make sure that
everyone ready
 to go
we dance every day with friends
i feel brilliant this music is better
there is only one night
now that sing out the song
there is only one night
not for me to be lucky unveiled
not for me to be lucky unveiled
myself to be very lucky unveiled
not for me to be lucky unveiled
myself to be very lucky unveiled
the sun is about reducing the
our energies are improving
i do not want to escape
from what it hopes is happening ahah

you will meet with people
who will try to direct you
one way has no night
the other has no day
you will meet with people
who will try to rule your way
one with persuasion
another with torment
youve your own weight to lift
your own road to travel
you your soul your body and your mind
if you understand that youre alive
dont let that go too easily
because at the end of the day
you are the driver
a time will come
when the road splits in two
one to the left turn
and one to the right turn
a time will come
when youll have to choose
between either left turn
and right turn
and when that time comes be ready
be sure of your choice
dont stand back
go directly ahead whichever way you choose
do it without doubt
because at the end of the day
you are the driver
and there is hope in every rising sun
oh but to share it oh but to share
and there is hope in every turn on the road
oh but to share it oh but to share
and there is hope in every clean glass of water
oh but to share it oh but to share
and there is hope in every heartbeat
oh but to share it oh but to share
so tell what will be
swimming against the tide
you can swim with it
or against it
so tell what will we
do running against the wind
you can run with it
or against it
there is a third option
shelter from the wind a boat in the sea
fly in the sky
grow a few seeds
and youll understand it to be true
that at the end of the day
your heart is your master

that i wouldnt get word of her until id tie the knot
i walked through cobh and baile na mona
cathar tún tóime and sherkin is
on the east coast someone told me
that it was the laughing stock of néidín
*
if my health is spared ill be long relating
of the boat that sailed out from anach cuan
and the keening after of mother and father
as the laying out of each corpse was done
oh king of graces who died to save us
it was a small affair but for one or two
but a boatload bravely on a calm sailing
without storm or rain to be swept to doom
the boat sprang a leak and left all those people
and frightened sheep out adrift on the tide
it beats all telling what fate befell them
eleven strong men and eight women died
young boys they were lying where crops were ripening
from the strength of youth they were borne away
in their wedding clothes for their wake they robed them
oh king of glory mans hope is vain
may burning mountains come tumbling downward
on that place of drowning may curses fall
full many the soul it has left in mourning
and left without hope of a bright days dawn
the cause of their fate was no fault of sailing
it was the boat that failed them the caisleán nua
and left me to make with a heart thats breaking
this sad lamentation for anach cuan
*
as long as i have health
there will be said about hose
who died at annaghdown
and my sorrow tomorrow every father and mother
woman and child are weeping
but such a beautiful day without wind or rain
the whole boat of them to be swept away
king of graces who created heaven and paradise
it would not have been much to take two or three
but such a beautiful day without wind or rain
the whole boat of them to be swept away
*
the thing you were saying
when we were alone
that it would be easier
to let our love grow now
completely together
leave all you have built up aside
and well go ahead with it
i wont let you down
i wont leave without you no way
i dont sleep well at night
it is time for me now
i feel a little better every day
but i admit
a change has not come over me
dont you hear my voice
im still standing here
its clear whats in store for us
well set out quietly on this path
at last at last
*
i walked down by the sea
right wearily
my heart it was tormented
from a northern sky the small clouds did fly
and sorely i lamented
im sorry now i swear
that i didnt care
to heed my mothers caution
she spoke to me fair saying dont venture there
dont go the road to ballyhaunis
yet dearly did i love
my fairhaired girl
in the garden that morning early
your lips as tender as the foam on the oceans rim
and cheeks like red hawberries
i put my arm around your waist
but my mind knew no ease
though the small birds sang so gaily
i wished we were going under white sails blowing
be it fair or stormy weather
my own hearts dear
if youd come away
to that land of ships from ireland
theres no heartache nor theres no pain
that wouldnt find a cure for certain
you are the one ive always loved
so save me now from dying
for without gods grace ill never survive
on this street in ballyhaunis
*
as i rode out to view the flowers
being in the morning early
a pretty fair maid i chanced to spy
her flowers they grew most neatly
her cherry cheeks her ruby lips
her eyes would tickle a daisy
i took this fair maid by the hand
she said young man go easy
im a plowboy my seeds to grow
and thats well known to my neighbors
and manys a field ive plowed indeed
and thats without much labor
ill plow ill sow ill reep ill mow
ill gather it into the barn
ill play a reel and ill dance with you
on the banks of carraige báine
i would rather than all ireland
or than the wealth of the king of spain
that you and i young fairheaded one
spend a while drinking our health
you and i to be married together
without the consent of father or mother
young maid of the sweetest kisses
on the banks of the carraige báine
ill spread my mantle for you young man
if it werent the breadth of a farthing
if i thought your mind was as good as your word
you know tis you i would rather
for want of any company
you need not go no further
but rise me up to the top of the hill
and show me the carraige báine
*
how sad i was
when i left home
and bade farewell to you
ireland my love
though i looked happy
my eyes were tearful
separated from you
whom ill never see again
separated forever
by hills and by valleys
and never again see
the beautiful city of cork
separated forever
from faithful friends
oh faithful friends of my youth
on the banks of the lee
and many the times the bright sun
of the skies would rise
and many the times it would set
under waves of water
since i left that day
from my loyal mother éire
and went overseas
to this land
and in my heart still
there are memories still vivid
in the morning afternoon
and at nightfall
in my vision again
i remain forever
on the true rock of my youth
on the banks of the lee
*
last night and i wandering as you do
on the other side of my lands i was
there a beautiful woman approached him
who left me sick and moody afterwards
with her lovely bearing and shape
her sweet words and thin lips
i hastened to be in her presence
but for all of ireland id not tell her name
if this maiden submits to my voice
are said my bel would be true
in fact you or déanfainn your business
your léirchur for and out
your would read léirstair me dear
are most regards i was kissing from my heart
your i would give her a maeldoid the championship
and ireland id not tell her name
oh my true love be sympathetic to me
and especially if i may write
i would be laughing like the white of the branches
if i get certainty as to who she is
her friends are not happy with me
for us to make a home together
but if she is according to what you say
dont fear to tell me her name
*
lying outside in the sunshine
one smile pulling together
walk our way the one human race
hand in hand you can do anything
reflecting each other under the heat of the sun
reflecting each other under the flag of the sky
reflecting each other under the heat of the sun
reflecting each other under the flag of the sky
side by side learning and growing
dancing and having fun our friendship blooming
with one heart the soul laughing
great eagerness in the childrens eyes
*
i am full of sorrow here alone
unable to hear the cockerel blackbird or corncrake
nor the sparrow thrush or snipe
sunday has no meaning for me without these things
and alas alas all ireland oh
for my blackbird oh
my heart is heavy with sorrow
if i were in ardaigh cuan
beside the distant mountain
it was often that i would go to visit
the valley of the cuckoo on sunday
*

last night as i traveled alone
coming towards loch na naomh
all my hair stood on end
from great fright without knowing why
the stars of the skies lit up
and i could see the woman
but she pierced my side with a clean sharp arrow
and left a black bruise in the center of my heart
some thoughts crossed my mind
as i greeted again this beauty
wondering what magic powers directed her to me
at the dead of night in that eerie place
come up and look well at me
i am the young fair maid from greece
you are the love of my heart from day until night
your voice and the brilliant utterances of your mouth
courteous young woman dont confront me
just look at me and see that i am not well
for i am troubled cross and gloomy
part of my deformity is that i am without limbs
dont think for a minute you will get rid of me so easy
for its many a kings son that i put to death
now that i have discovered how goodlooking you are
i would travel the length of ireland to be with you
*
o máire be wise
come with me to the mountain
and leave me not
to pine at night all alone
im building a fine
brightroomed house for you
where we shall live without a care
and little rent to pay
how grand to see
the mountain top at sunrise
no cloud in the sky
no venom in the air
the badger in the meadow
the fox on the peak
and the hare leaping for joy
in the heather
at evening cows come lowing home
udderripe for milking
birds sing sweetly
from the glen at nightfall
man and wife live happily
together there
abd the old do not weary
of being old
oats and barley grow there
potatoes and all other plants too
the traveller is invited
and all are welcome
oreilly plays music there
theres brandy wine and beer there
for goodly company
with money flowing free
the still is ever working
and barrels ever filling
princes and nobles come
and drink there
the nicest priest
youll find is there
ó máire heed me
and come along with me

i have a cow on the mountain
and i have been after her for a while
since i lost my sense with my spouse
driving her east and west
wherever the sun goes
from morning till the gold of the evening
when i look over
in the place where my love used to be
oh a stream of tears falls from my eyes
o bright king of power
may you have mercy on my case
because it is the darkhaired woman
who left me in sorrow
dark woman of the glen
its the dark woman i prefer
the woman of the nicest laugh
her cheek like snow
and her throat like the swan
and her waist slim narrow and beautiful
there is no decent young man
from dublin to galway
or from there to tuam
who isnt travelling and journeying
on lovely brown horses
and hoping for that beautiful darkhaired woman
he who would see my house
with no roof on it but straw
and built on one side of the road
where the bee goes
and makes there its nest
with the heat and the bright gold sun
when the sapling grows up
no respect remains for it
but rather looking forward to kissing the branch
and my fair pretty girl
who eloped from me with a waster
my five hundred thousand farewells to her

and through the bog the run proceeded
til he caught his horns in a clump of gorse
and on his back i jumped unheeded
when the sergeant stood in rochestown
with a force of guards to apprehend us
the goat he tore his trousers down
and made rags of his breeches and new suspenders

instead of spending my life looking after you

like holy communion
but you dont really care for

hangs on my wall
i would dare to speak its name
if i knew what it was called
i would dare to speak its name
if i knew what it was called

oh bríd óg omalley
you have left my heart breaking
youve sent the death pangs
of sorrow to pierce my heart sore
a hundred men are craving
for your breathtaking beauty
youre the fairest of maidens
in oriel for sure
no spectacle is fairer
than moonbeams on the harbor
or the sweet scented blossoms
of the sloe on the thorn
but my love shines much brighter
in looks and in stature
that honeylipped beauty
who never said wrong
im a handsome young fellow
who is thinking of wedlock
but my life will be shortened
if i dont get my dear
my love and my darling
prepare now to meet me
on next sunday evening
on the road to drum slieve
tis sadly and lonely
i pass the time on sunday
my head bowed in sorrow
my sights heavy with woe
as i gaze upon the byways
that my true love walks over
now shes wed to another
and left me forlorn
*
it was on one bright march morning
i bid new orleans adieu
and i took the road to jackson town
my fortune to renew
i cursed all foreign money
no credit could i gain
which filled my heart with longing
for the lakes of pontcahrtrain
i stepped on board of a railroad car
beneath the morning sun
i rode the rods till evening
and i laid me down again
all strangers there no friends to me
till a dark girl towards me came
and i fell in love with a creole girl
by the lakes of pontchartrain
i said my pretty creole girl
my money heres no good
and if it werent for the alligators
id sleep out in the wood
youre welcome here kind stranger
our house is very plain
but we never turned a stranger out
on the banks of pontchartrain 
she took me into her mammys house
and she treated me right well
the hair upon her shoulders
in jet black ringlets fell
to try to paint her beauty
im sure t would be in vain
so handsome was my creole girl
by the lakes of pontchartrain
i asked her if shed marry me
she said that this could never be
for she had got a lover
and he was far at sea
she said that she would wait for him
and true she would remain
till hed return to his creole girl
by the lakes of pontchartrain
so fare thee well my bonny own girl
i never may see you more
but ill neer forget your kindness
in the cottage by the shore
and at each social gathering
a flowing glass ill drain
and ill drink a health to my creole girl
by the lakes of pontchartrain
*
and west by the river without a doubt or lie
there is a quiet gentle beauty
and her waist is as bright as any swan on the wave
from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet
she is the woman that tormented my heart
and left me heartbroken
there is nothing that will cure me
since my true love rejected me
i would prefer than all of ireland
or the wealth of the king of spain
that you and i could be together in a quiet spot
in a wood far from our friends
oh you and i to be married my love
with the permission of father and mother
oh young maiden of the sweet kisses
youre the sun of the white rocks
oh beauty of the white hair
if you would be mine
you would have everything your friends would like
from silk to hats from head to toe
and the best of everything in the city
your cows would be driven every noon to the town
and the bees in the meadow would sing sweetly for you
you would have your fill of drink
and have coaches to take you
all around the edge of the white rocks
*
im a boy from the erne
and i could charm a nice young girl
i would not ask for her wealth
as i am rich enough myself
i own cork as big as it is
two sides of the glen and tyrone
and not to repeat myself
im the heir of county mayo
i will go tomorrow
to make ale in the wood
without a cot without a boat
without a pinch of gruel with me
but leaves of the branches
as bedclothes over my head
and o good for you
and you looking across at me
a cowherd my pet
ive never been accustomed to be
but playing and drinking and being
with nice young women on the mountain
even though i lost my wealth
its not as though i lost my senses
and your kiss is no more to me
now than a shoe worn for a year
my darling and my love
dont marry the grey old man
but marry a young man my pet
if he only lives but a year
or you will be without
a descendant to succeed you
who would shed their tears
heavily at eve or at morn

oh yellow bittern i grieve your dying
and your bones stretched out notwithstanding your humour
it isnt want of food but of the damned drink
thats left you dead on your back
this is worse to me than the fall of troy
you lying dead on the bare stones
you brought no hurt or harm to anyone
as you preferred wine to well water
it isnt your birds there that im lamenting
the cuckoo the corncrake or the dappled heron
its my yellow bittern who was full of heart
and was like myself in style and color
he was forever drinking the draught
and its said that i am the same way
there isnt a drop i could get that i wouldnt swallow
for fear that i could die from thirst
my love asked me to put down the drink
or i wouldnt be alive much longer
but i told her that she lied
and id live longer if i kept on drinking
didnt you all see the bird of the long gullet
who died from thirst a little while ago
so my bosom friends drown your thirst
as you wont get a drop at all after youre dead
*
i went to the fair and i sold my cow
for five pounds in silver and a guinea in gold
should i drink all the money and hand out the gold
its nobodys business let them leave me alone
i could go to the woods and pluck berries or nuts
and apples from branches even herding the cows
should i lie neath the trees for some hours in repose
its nobodys business let them leave me alone
id visit the neighbors for dancing and fun
markets the races and gatherings galore
if i see merry people then merry well be
its nobodys business let them leave me alone
they say im a waster and down on my luck
no goods or fine clothing no stock or no store
should i live in a stable contented and free
its nobodys business let them leave me alone
i know this girl shes kind and shes fair
her neck like the swan and her cheek like the rose
should we set out together for a fardistant shore
its nobodys business let them leave me alone
i went to the fair and i sold my cow
for five pounds in silver and a guinea in gold
should i drink all the money and hand out the gold
its nobodys business let them leave me alone
should i drink all the money and hand out the gold
its nobodys business let them leave me alone

i went to the fair and sold my cow
for five pounds of silver and a yellow guinea of gold
if i drink the silver and if i give away the gold
oh what is that to anyone else
if i drink the silver and if i give away the gold

plucking apples from branches or herding cows
if i stretch out for a while beneath a tree relaxing

i went to the market
and traded my cow
for five pounds in money
and a gold guinea coin
if i drank all the money
and my gold i did share
since its no ones concern
then so no one should care
if i go to the green woods
wild berries to store
plucking apples from bowers
or herding the cows
if i relax in the shade
for an hour or more
since its no ones concern
then so no one should care
if i go to the céilís
to dances or sports
attend markets and races
and events of that sort
if i see people merry
and their merriment share
since its no ones concern
then so no one should care
people are saying
im a cad gone astray
without goods or possessions
no cow and no care
if its my own desire
to live in a craw
since its no ones concern
then so no one should care

well i took a walk on the big walk salthill prom
around this middle of the day
and i met with a nice beautiful girl
and we started to talk
and i dont know what it was
what came over me
with her black hair
and her blue eyes
and i took her hand
i gave her a dance
and i kissed the galway girl
we were half way there when the rain came down
later in the day
and we ran down to her apartment
on a fine soft day
well when i woke and i was by myself
she left me
with a broken heart with a pain inside
and i dont know what it was
what came over me
when i met with that girl
ive seen all
there is to see
but nothing the likes of the galway girl
*
shes your granny
shes your granny
shes your granny
the hag with the money
shes your granny
from the town of iorrais mór
and she would put coaches
on the roads of cois farraige
if youd see the steam boat
going past tóin uí loing
and the wheels turning
speedily at her flanks
shed scatter the store
nine times to the rear
but she never keeps pace
with the hag with the money
do you reckon hed marry
do you reckon hed marry
do you reckon hed marry
hag with the money
i know hell not marry
i know hell not marry
because hes too young
and hell drink the money
well soon have a wedding

by two in the village
well soon have a wedding
well soon have a wedding

and i was one night
on saint bridgets day
at a wake
down at castlegar
it is there that i saw a fair maid
that i took a liking to
for she was enchanting
lovely happy serene
oh it is she who surely
confused my mind
and the finest doctors
would not cure me
until the beautiful woman
comes and checks my pulse
its only then
that i would feel better
because the reason for my sadness
is that i am not allowed to visit
in the lonely valleys
where my love goes
because another man is minding her
through day and night
and courting
with my fair love
but if i knew that you
were not meant for me
i would not laugh
nor play with you
and that my heart was so closed
in love with you
as a nail that would be driven
through my heart
i would rather put a knife
through my heart
and for me to be left
until i would die
than to be driven far away
from my people
like a gust of wind
blowing from castlegar
*
over us a bright star in the night
the sea is quiet and the wind is peaceful
the quiet sea asleep in the wind
below in the glen the misty glen
the kingdom of the sun in the golden castle
the sea is quiet and the wind is peaceful
the quiet sea asleep in the wind
magic charms the people there
bright lights in the golden castle
the sea is quiet and the wind is peaceful
the quiet sea asleep in the wind
*
a hundred farewells to last night
and my sorrow its not starting anew
with the handsome young fellow
who beguiled me awhile on his knee
you placed your claim on me
o my fair love but im not meant for you
for a hundred sharp sorrows
the mountains lie between you and me
this garden is growing wild
my bright love and i am alone
and every flower is growing
fairer than you ever saw
no harpsong was heard along this road
nor the sweet songs of birds
since he left me my love
that fair scion for caisleán uí néill
in caisleán uí néill is the one
who has spoiled my fame
and i can only compare him
to the north star above yonder town
the taste of his kisses was sweeter
than roses in bloom
and with sorrow for my darling
ill have only a short while to live
and why o my fair love
in early summer dont you come to me
down into the glens or an island
where the cuckoo sings
cows sheep or goats id not ask
as a dowry for you
just my hand in yours
and the freedom to be talking till twelve
*
i spent last night with a girl in louisiana
im far away shes still in my head
such beauty i never saw before

oh wait for me a while
it wont be long now
until im with you forever

though it is enjoyable to be sailing
i cannot say im enjoying it just now
i would rather be in bosta
planting the corn in the field
oh lord ive a heavy sighing heart
my love is far away from me tonight
im away in the north at the cape of norway
while shes at loch an fhir mhaoil
it set sail for home with us
it sailed round orkney
with new masts and white sails on her
she was running with the tide
since i got a definite order
to sail the ship
ill steer her prow
towards macdonald of the kyle

this feeling is beautiful 
i feel amazing inside my body
the energy sparking in me
when i meet you
and through the city the town
rising to the top were in the zone
the bright sun is in my pocket
my feet moving below
i feel warm and happy when im with you oh
i cannot stop my feet
moving with you to and fro
you prefer this way
so dont stop
under the lights going leeward
there is nowhere else to hold back our fracas
the movement protects us forever

nothing ever before me but you
and the blinding dance dance dance
hoping to come along soon
with the dance dance dance come here
every single thing i should not push

and we will not leave soon so keep going

and dance dance dance

and dance dance dance

the network full of our enthusiasm
our heritage is going in search
of a place for us in the world
you youre a hardnosed ignoramus
going out of my mind since i was fourteen
listening to that shit
rules that make no sense
take the flag with you
you should have fun too
our country belongs to us
and we wont surrender anything
deeds to match our words
and we wont sell her out
let us go on
this is your moment
dont look back
and do it with courage
throw your hands up
this life is what is ahead of us

but now that its here the commotion has arrived

upon the passion tree
alas and alaso
it is your son mother
dont you recognise me
alas and alaso
is that the wee son
that was nourished at marys breast
alas and alaso
is that the son
that was born to me in the stable
alas and alaso
is that the son
i carried for three quarters
alas and alaso
darling little son
your mouth and your nose are cut
alas and alaso
blunt nails were pushed through
his feet and his hands
ochón agus ochónó
and a spear pierced
through his beautiful chest
alas and alaso

of a lovely woman i happened upon in the loneliness of the beach
at the loop of the greenest woods in the small hours before daybreak
the question she asked me so quietly and gently
the world is asleep softest is the white quilt
and if youre with me be with me oh love of my life
and if youre with me be with me out the front of my home
if youre with me and give to me every inch of your heart
its my thousand hills wont you to me on sunday like women
from you were turning as a light lively and strong little boy
and as youll be turning and playing cards with the women
*
i did a trick
in o domhnalls house last night
and a second trick
at the holstelry next door
id prefer not to add
the third trick to my story
and i often spent
a good with her
oh god almighty
what drove me to this district
when its many a fine lass
id find in my own townland
i called into the house
of my own true love
and the old woman put me twisting rope
til i was outside the door
if youll be mine be mine
oh treasure of my heart
if youll be mine be mine
before the whole world
if youll be mine be mine
every inch of your heart
alas that youre not
my wife this sunday
my head is gray
and its not from old age
fair words butter
no parships anyway
im after you now for a year
and its useless
and im like a deer on the moor
and the hounds are yelping after me
id plow id toil
id sow seed in the clay
and id do a steady job
beautiful smooth and even
id shoe the maddest horse
ever to walk on grass
and the woman still wouldnt elope
with a man whod do that
*
if youre with me
be with me in front of all the people in the house
if youre with me
be with me all day and all night
if youre with me
be with me truly in your heart
it is my great sadness
that you arent mine on sunday as my wife
if the cat had a dowry
how nicely his mouth would be kissed
and if he didnt its a long way
from home he would be driven
the twisted wretched witchs daughter
is married since last night
and my girls at home
with no one to kiss her mouth
and what misfortune that
directed me to this place
there is many a girl in the village
that i left behind
because of a fight and a quarrel
and something that wasnt even true
musha a silly hag
and her daughter that had no sense
i would plow and plant
the seed deep in the soil
and i would drive the cows to the fields
where the tallest grass grows
i would shoe a horse that was
the nicest and fastest ever
and a woman would elope with a man
who wouldnt even do that
*
little how i knew your ways
im a fool
still the fire in my heart
never leaves me
haunting me
time past wont disappear
memories stay never to die
my heart will never change
strange now its too late for me
by myself
empty as the days go by
without you
haunting me
movements of a clouded sky
and it rains
peaceful is the dark at night
full of silence
haunting me
whose is the sorrow
among my people
i feel alone
*
who are you kind stranger
who are you
are you gentle or aggressive
since your traumatic ordeal
who are you
and did you come from far away
from west from north from east from south
did you come from cold or from heat
who are you
come in tense stranger
come in
sit by the table
have a drink
or have a rest
and tell us the reason why
your quiet face is dark and lonely
why your eyes are full of sadness
who are you
in my pulse
in magical golden company
in my footstep in beds
in the great book of every months
i dont arrive or ever come upon
whats essential for my needs
and in valleys
in forests with the scattering of seeds
i fill with hope and then deposit
with each nights storm
i dont feel and i have never felt
whats essential for my needs
and goodbye gentle stranger
goodbye for now
and i wish you every success
and happiness from here on in
and you will always be welcome inside this heart
whether lonely whether happy
whether the suns wide smile is on your face

my sweet sweet sweet darkhaired love
put your pale soft hand around me now
mouth of honey that has the smell of thyme
it is a heartless man that would not love you
the girls of this town are furious
pulling their hair and letting it blow in the wind
for me the best man in the countryside
but i would dump them all for my hearts love
lay your sweet sweet sweet head
lay your sweet head on me
mouth of honey that has the smell of thyme
it is a heartless man that would not love you
*
this is not enough for me
ive spent the day in a fix
i say whats on my mind
focusing on every single problem
every single kindness
dismissed with astonishment
im only four five seconds from the limit
with only three days left until friday
going back home again before sunset
pity youre not the one who escapes
every single thing i need
positive about the time within
with a light shining on us as we run
heading off no coming back
what good is it when nothings done
the greatest thing is that youre here
thinking of how
to extract sense from me
one question a thousand times
anything on my mind
*
if you marry the hackler
its you who will be crying
my own true love my fair maiden
oh you will suffocate
with the roots of the earth
my own true love my fair maiden
oh you will sit until
it is the middle of the night
rummaging for a candle
and grabbing the spade
youd much prefer to have me
and the sweet music of my pipes
my own true love my fair maiden
if you marry the weaver
its you who will be crying
my own true love my fair maiden
youll soon be weak
and lost from the working of the loom
my own true love my fair maiden
oh you will sit until
it is the middle of the night
rummaging for a candle
and moaning from the poverty
youd much prefer to have me
and the sweet music of my pipes
my own true love my fair maiden
if you marry the tailor
its you who will be crying
my own true love my fair maiden
therell be wisps of straw piled at the door
like a dog would drop his dung
my own true love my fair maiden
oh you will sit until
it is the middle of the night
rummaging for a candle
and gnawing bits of cloth
youd much prefer to have me
and the sweet music of my pipes
my own true love my fair maiden

the wind speaks to us
a beautiful sound
the world listens
sigh of the wind
sigh of the wind
flowing through the branches of the trees
the gale goddess under nights shade

with an ancestral sound
the world is ready
music of the gale
little birds
chant with the wind
kingdom of the skies
the world listens
the world is ready
music of the gale
the world is ready

we cannot feel sick
we feel nothing we dont care
to hell with it to hell with it
i love it the craic in a while
phone ringing loud party about to start
i feel the love i feel the love
123 123 back x 3
throwing them back whos counting
im gonna swing from the chandelier
from the chandelier
im gonna let the oars loose to drift away
to drift away
im gonna fly right through the night
let the tears flow
im gonna swing from the chandelier
from the chandelier
i am only alive
unable to talk or see anymore
fill my glass til its overfull
before i go right out of my head
look i am only alive
unable to talk or see anymore
fill my glass til its overfull
before i go right out of my head
right out of my head
the sun is rising im stuck here
what happened last night i dont know
the utter shame the utter shame
*
i went on a visit to the roses
and looked towards the sky
and around the northern islands
like a deer being followed by a dog
everyone at the bay would say
on seeing me down by the quay
i can see clearly by your sadness
that you are a man being chased
i met a beautiful young woman
but she spoke sharply
if you are a man who is engaged to a young woman
i do not praise your trade
i saw a man on the mainland
walking without shoes yesterday
i think you are the young man
that you are being chased
we became tired and sad
and i asked the gentle woman
where will we get a drink
that would lift the sadness from our hearts
there is a little house by the road
and they always keep a drop
go and knock on the table
and you will not pay a penny
i wasnt long making music
before many came to the house
everyman with a glass in his hand
to congratulate the couple
spirits were widely available
there was much drinking
and if i pulled odonnells gallon
my score would easily be settled
i happened to go into the pub
and i was nervous to sit down
in case the chase would come
and the young woman would be taken from me
when we found everything was as it should be
and i thought i should sit down
she said make music
and you will not pay a penny
when we relieved our tiredness with sadness
the young woman asked me
where do you live during the day
when you do not have a house of your own
i spend some time in the pub
i do not place importance on money
the amount i earn during the day
i spend on enjoyment at night
*
listen to me people lads and girls
a new story every day messing for no reason
i always know youll be up and about
looking out waiting
wanting my blessing
every single thing lights turn them off
well have fun give me more
na na na
na na na
late home trouble who cares
well have fun again
all of us thrilled
keep your head you can
everyone sin out the song
keep your head you can
everyone sing  out the song
*
what shall we do without timber
the woods have all been cut down
theres no mention of cill chais or its people
the peal of bells is no more
the place where the lady resided
who was held in esteem above all
where earls and nobility frequented
and the sonorous mass was heard
geese and ducks can no longer be heard
nor the eagle cry in the bay
nor the hum of the bees as they labor
storing honey and wax for all
we miss the sweet tones of birdsong
as the day fades in the west
or the call of the cuckoo each evening
calling the people to rest
a dark cloud envelopes the country
and no longer the sun shines bright
darkness descends from the sky there
and even the rivers run dry
theres no ivy holly or berries
but rocks and barren waste
not a tree is left for shelter
and the game has all strayed away
and now to crown our misfortune
the prince of the gael has fled
he has left with the noble lady
and is welcomed in france and spain
the people are brokenhearted
they have lost her support when in need
she was ever so kind to her people
and always gave alms to the poor
i implore jesus and mary
that she will one day return
to her people who will be rejoicing
with bonfires and fiddles and song
that this great home of our ancestors
the beautiful cill chais be restored
and until the day of judgement
will it never again lay low
*
lovable kitty do no reject me
walk away now and escape with me
in a wooded glen or mountain
or for a while in the flowering wood
i would marry you unknownst to the world
or to the priest if i could
and if we cannot be bound in ireland
lets both go abroad
i arrived in this town last night
and it was quite late for me
intending to make the match
and that i would never be parted from her
her father did not reach an agreement
it was not my fault
i bid farewell to my kinsfolk
we shall never meet again
i received neither welcome nor hospitality
since i came to this village
since my love heard
that i gave my hand to a woman
they think i am a married man
but if they do it is not true
by the book which is in my pocket
i was enticing a young woman

i arrived in this town last night
and it was quite late for me
intending to make the match
and that i would never be parted from her
her father did not reach an agreement
it was not my fault
i bid farewell to my kinsfolk
we shall never meet again
i received neither welcome nor hospitality
since i came to this village
since my love heard
that i gave my hand to a woman
they think i am a married man
but if they do it is not true
by the book which is in my pocket
i was enticing a young woman
*
oh kitty ní ayra
its a shame how you left me forlorn
and the heart in my bosom
as dark as a black lump of coal
if i had but one wish
to ask of the good lord above
is to grapple with death each day
ere you left me alone
the gables are falling
and the rest of the house is in chaos
since the good woman left
who was innocent gentle and kind
her three seasons with me
seem less than one hour in time
its my poignant regret
that a cold lonely grave is her home
and kitty my love
isnt it happy for you now to dwell
with the saints up in heaven
and thousands of saints without guile
and not be like me
just praying and pining each day
for in the land of the saints
is the one that i chose above all
*
i worship you my little child come on earth
sleep peacefully my child
i worship him weak naked and helpless
sleep peacefully my child
tell me my love as you lie in the manger
tell me why you lay stretched in the straw
you are a treasury of grace and jesus son of god
sleep peacefully my child
sleep peacefully my child
mary my mother and gentle nurse
sleep peacefully my child
i am a treasury of grace and jesus son of god
sleep peacefully my child
desperately poor i came with desire into this world
to save wandering exiles from death
and when i am suspended on high
they will lean towards me
sleep peacefully my child
sleep peacefully my child
*
he comes with the wind
he goes on the waves
he hears my prayer
when i call him in the darkest moment of the night
softly softly softly
i sleep softly my christ
softly softly softly
i sleep softly in your heart
naked he stands at the dawn
in the newborn child
he is there at the end
as the soul parts from the body
there is no one so full of mercy and love
there is no way to understand your goodness
you are my teacher and guide
i sleep softly in your heart
*
on the green stubblefields of autumn
i saw you my sweetheart
nice were your feet in shoes
and wonderful your nimble gait
your hair the color of roses
and your ringlets tightly plaited
alas that were not married
or on board ship sailing away
the boys around here are
complaining and getting fired up
and the ones with the highpiled hair
are making homes for my brownhaired girl
if the king of spain would
go abroad with his assembled men
i would trample pasture and wilderness
and i would be with my brownhaired girl
if only my brownhaired girl and i
were buying cows at the fair
go and come first love
until we go over to gaothbearra
even if the tops of the branches were parted
and the swan were separated from the waves
that would not separate us
and those who go against us are foolish

theres an apple tree growing in the garden
and well sit down until they put the earth on it
in case the local youth fall in love with it
you will move
i will move
and we will move together
oh beautiful charming branches
i prefer the smith that is working in the workshop
hitting the hammer strongly and steadily
earning his pay and drinking it in the tavern
i prefer the farmer herding happily
on a nice day in spring with a plow and gloves
applying himself to his work and turning earth
i prefer the fisherman out in his little boat
casting his net and catching the salmon
fighting with the waves from morning until night

brave heart brave heart
brave heart brave heart
the king of scotland died alas
without a son in this life
a man came from the south
king edward the first
oh a cruel pagan
the crowd fought
the nobel commoners
between themselves
forced to forget
their own patriot
this legend
the king died
without a son in this life
edward has the title
the young fought
people and lords
between themselves
champions so strong
stood in such a war
a champion without soul
a champion without way
who hanged thirty
thirty without nobility
and young boys
cruel heart
living legend
their dignity grew
from the word of the scots
six brave years
brave enough
he sacrificed his hand
too complicated
too sad
they shouted of their freedom
the man that was brave
brave heart
*
when i die
dont put me under the ground
take me to the pub
and set me on the table
the place were i will hear
the tankers banging
id prefer it for nine hours
than the soothing music of the cuckoo
and the jug would be filled
and it would be full
there is a girl in this town
and she is quite joyful
she is quite cheery
and theres a shine on her forehead
i didnt see macasamhail
in town or anywhere
but posey nelly was
at the bottom of the ship
and the jug would be filled
and it would be full
will you come or will you stay
or will you come donald
will you come or will you stay
or did you drink your share
i will come and i wont stay
i have had my share to drink
and i will have the pretty girl
if she takes my advice
and the jug would be filled
and it would be full
this town is a nice town
the town of cnáimhsí is nice
this town is a better town
than any town in this place
they are whispering mass here
mills and workshops
isnt the young maid lucky
to live here
and the jug would be filled
and it would be full

and i went the byways
oh love of my heart

as he was the younger
cooach mo lon du bui
i returned to my home
dejected and broken
oh love of my heart
for three quarters
i lay down alone and forlorn
cooach mo lon du bui
she stayed with the groogach
for a year and three quarters
oh love of my heart
and then she returned
a disgraced and shamed molly
cooach mo lon du bui
oh servant in yonder

oh love of my heart
in spite of my friends

cooach mo lon du bui

id have fun with the darkhaired maiden
and rise early in the morning
id have fun with the darkhaired maiden
id have fun with the lass
while the world would be sleeping
i played when we woke
and when the sails were unfurled
on monday after sunday
we left the orkneys on the seonaid
blue sea was running under the stubble
and sending torrents from the bottom of the abyss
a reef being tied and a reef being loosened
the sea at her back noisy and whistling
there about the strait of rome
we needed to lash the boom
there about the strait of france
the stick was in the hand and the wind was driving
oh there will be ropes that do not need splicing
on my maiden coming home
you would need a portion coming from her shop
although it was a crown a quarter
although it would be a crown an inch
you would need a portion of it coming home

there was a noble lady a short while ago
and she put up with my sharp excesses
she was overcome in the towns
but she gave her sway in front of the world
but if i could get one of her things
from under the arches of the church
i would be without doubt on my subject
but now i am sick and weak and i have no hope of a cure
and my family soon will mourn after me
i wandered of ireland and munster together
and along howth in search of women
and never saw anyone to measure
to make my pleasure but my white molly
irish women to put together
and its almost an entertainment for me to say that
its what everyone says who saw my fair lady
that she gave her sway from county clare
the sun is going and the heat is leaving
and i am not able to subdue the thirst
because im sure that from november to february
she will not be finished with me until michaels day
but i promise you that it was not that
my own wonder was against her
but because of my first love i did abandon her 
she went collecting charity for her daughters
and i am worn sick and my right foot is
from when yonder young woman took me in
i tried once or twice to give her a little kiss
for id long to roam with my own sweetheart
for im tired of drinking and im seldom sober
im a constant rover from town to town
but now im dying and my days are over 
come bags misty and lay me down

i sing of a night in bethlehem
a night as bright as dawn
i sing of that night in bethlehem
the night the word was born
the skies are glowing gaily
the earth in white is dressed
see jesus in the cradle
drink deep in his mothers breast
and there on a lonely hillside
the shepherds bow down in fear
when the heavens open brightly
and gods message rings out so clear
glory now to the father
in all the heavens high
and peace to his friends on earth below
is all the angels cry

there were many noble people
there were ordinary folk from scotland
the school master and the minister
the warrior mcauley was there
donal donal twas donal who made the wedding
twas donal and morag made the wedding famous
there were hens and geese there
there were more than a dozen sea birds
there all of it was and the favorite food there
was the hens of the birds that they preferred
there were salmon and trout from the erne
and an abundance of game and wild birds
the prime beef and veal were the tastiest
there was roast lamb and venison there
the drinks were generous and plentiful
there was spanish brandy and wine
there was homemade poteen and honey mead
there was beer and ale from ireland there
*
young donal if you cross the ocean
take me with you  dont forget
youll have a keepsake on a fairday and market
and the daughter of a greek king for a bedmate
you promised me but you lied to me
that youd meet me at the sheepfold
i whistled and called a thousand times for you
but all i got was
the lambs bleating
i gave you my love when i was little
and even more when i got bigger 
and not the love that a lamb gives its mother
but everlasting secure love that cant be broken
first time i saw you twas a sunday evening
twas at the easter as i was kneeling
twas on christs passion that i was reading
but my mind it was on you and my own heart bleeding
you have taken east and west from me
youve taken the moon and the sun from me
youve taken the heart from within my breast
but my greatest fear is that youve taken god from me

look women working by day and late at night
they sing of bright days that were
a long way back and forth forever
*
a cock and a hen went together
they walked the length of ireland til their hearts broke
they went to galway with the rising of the sun
when the pair of them were jailed by the law
at uiliam ó huileáin they were put out to grass
they ate hill berries and slept in the heather
until the sheriff merrily came
and hustled the pair into bláthn rí
if you saw the cock on the day of the fair in the streets
a great hat at the rear and yellow gloves
four long spurs of spanish silver
and a whip in his hand as he came along like the king
they took him in until they spread his bones
and they spent that day sportively enough
and wouldnt it have been better for them to take the easy route
instead of the way their fame spread across county mayo

arise now and dress yourself quickly
til i gaze once again on your brow
and well go to the bishop of erin
in wedlock to pledge our vows
i love and cherish you dearly
elope with me love of my heart
wouldnt the person be silly or foolish
that would try to keep us apart
last night in a vision i saw her
as i lay asleep on my bed
she came to me as a treasure
this beautiful goldenhaired maid
her golden locks trailed on the green grass
a spate of beauty that none could surpass
and why should it worry the clergy
if i slept with my true love last night
oh lady of stature and honor
oh fair one of beauty so rare
the virtues of kindness and goodness
shine brightly from inside your heart
theres talk of the beauty of deirdre
of niamh and of helen so fair
but if all were bonded together
to my true love they would not compare
if you do not come soon to be with me
no longer on earth will i stay
for this love in my heart is expanding
and torments me by night and by day
ill dress you in silks and in satins
trimmed neatly in braids of gold
my true love prepare now and join me
and well live in contentment untold
i long that myself and my true love
are not many leagues out to sea
on a lonely and wooded island
where the clouds glide silent and free
and small birds could peacefully nest there
where the eagle and cuckoo could dwell
and id cast a spell on a small bird
the brightness of day to quell
arise now and dress yourself quickly
til i gaze once again on your brow
and well go to the bishop of erin
in wedlock to pledge our vows
i love and cherish you dearly
elope with me love of my heart
wouldnt the person be silly or foolish
that would try to keep us apart

ive a creel of turf with me
i sit down
and im cold and hungry
the maid of the tresses said
i wish id a strip of your cloak
its a pity i havent your little jaw
beyond under the sod
its a pity im not over
at eoghainín ó ragadáins
for a week or two until he would
repair my cloak for me
i would be driving his cattle
each afternoon
and id be collecting nuts
on the border on this townland
*
now in the beginning of autumn
and here i am thinking back
to the merry days of long ago
when i frolicked with my love
her face possessed blissful beauty
her heart joy and solace
that was long ago my boy
that was long ago long ago
in the depths of winter
did i meet her
when we were alone swiftly and poised
she offered me her hand
i stole a kiss from the young queen
and fell in love with her
that was long ago my boy
that was long ago long ago
my young boy
long before you saw the light of day
my young boy
long before you saw the light of day
wouldnt it be splendid if i could get back
that time for a short while
oh i would bring her anything
and she would have my eternal loyalty
this life is cruel this life is strange
a cloud darkens the sun
it was nice long ago my boy
it was nice long ago long ago
my young boy
long before you saw the light of day

a swallow came by a wandering fiann
that held a ring wandering a lake
in went the ring and ever since it dropped
theres been no sound tonight
a red bird of brindled wing
higher than other birds with his voice
going all around our heads
playing his melody in the air
in the air
*
one morning early i went out
on the shore of lough leinn
the leafy trees of summertime
and the warm rays of the sun
as i wandered through the townlands
and the luscious grassy plains
who should i meet but a beautiful maid
at the dawning of the day
not a shoe nor sock nor cape nor cloak
had the maiden from the sky
her golden hair in tresses hung
and touched the grass up high
in her hand she held a milking pail
in the dew she looked so fair
her beauty excelled even helen of troy
at the dawning of the day
the young maiden sat by my side
on a green grassy bench
joking her and claiming
that id never part with her
she turned and said please go away
you are not wide awake
here come the lights i must be gone
with the dawning of the day
*
it was christmas eve
and i was blind drunk
an old man next to me said
its my last christmas
he started to sing a tune
the rare old mountain dew
i softly bent my head down
and i thinking about you
wasnt i the lucky one
she came in well
i feel inside my heart
this coming year is ours
oh happy christmas
you are my treasure
things will get better yet
its out there ahead of us
the cars are like bars
and the rivers full of gold
but theres a sharp sting in the wind
its nowhere without noise
when you took my hand
on our first christmas ever
you promised me broadway
was out there for me
you were handsome
you were clever
queen of new york city
there was no end to the pleasure
the fun and games were outstanding
sinatra was swinging
the bells were ringing
we kissing and dancing
without a care in the world
and the nypd choir and they
singing galway bay
and the bells ringing away
the son of gods birthday
you worthless begger
you useless old pauper
shriveled up over there
like a hag in the corner
you scumbag you trash
you gobshite of badness
happy christmas my arse
shame its not over
and the nypd choir and they
singing galway bay
and the bells ringing away
the son of gods birthday
i had a good life ahead of me
aint that a grand story of yours
you snatched my dreams away
from me the first time i met you
i have them always love
stored away within my heart
dont leave me now woman
youre everything in life to me
and the nypd choir and they
singing galway bay
and the bells ringing away
the son of gods birthday
*
with your head weighed down you waited for me
depending on yourself to make it go well
in the days before us
well look for our own way and time
but its your choice wait now
its your choice ill be there
i will wait i will wait for you 
carry on by yourself and bring your luck with it
as we brush off memories
we have not seen all of life
and we want more to find excess
i will wait i will wait for you 
listen to us outside new tonight
happy bright ill wait there
i will wait i will wait for you
*
this is what my mother said to me
follow your own dream
spread you wings and fly
she took my hand and we went outside
we sat down and she said
spread you wings little butterfly
count the stars and be among them
take my hand and come with me
follow your dream and it will work out
she looked into my eyes
and i lowered my head
i got up
and followed my dream like she told me

i will leave this town
for it is dark and ugly
and go to connacht
or west to laighean uí eabhra
the place where ill get a kiss
from my darling and a thousand welcomes
a nice herd of cows
and permission to marry the tailor
mary and isnt it a pity
and me married to the scoundrel
who wont let me go to mass
on a holiday or a sunday
who wont take me to the pub
or drink a gold guinea with me
or hold me in his heart
as a young man would
the place where ill get a kiss
from my darling and a thousand welcomes
a nice herd of cows
and permission to marry the tailor
i married young
for the promise of money
my two hands full of them
my mind was not satisfied
isnt it a pity i cant be rid of him
as with a cow or sheep
if you dont like the bargain
you can take him back to the fair
i will leave this town
*
come here come here
it will be fine
theres nothing wrong with it
our time will come
but right now i want to go overboard
because we are here at the end of the day
together forever we remember it
dont be troubled now by things that are past
a new life will begin a new life will begin
come here come here
why cant you say anything
a new life will begin
a new life will begin

the harvest moon is rising into the sky
and autumns yellow sun is setting over the weir
the young bees hum amid the old brown leaves
in gaoth barra of the woods gaoth barra of the waves
the young winter cattle come slowly down to the fold
and the sheep frolic at the approach of the night
the wandering stream laughs and shouts
in gaoth barra of the woods gaoth barra of the waves
in the musical waters of the river lurks the salmon
and nearby the lark makes her nest
come the birds of the flock the starling and the blackbird
to your refuge unstinting gaoth barra of the waves
i pray to st patrick and st conal
i ask but one boon at the end of my life
that my soul should reside among the brown leaves
that grow thick on your shores gaoth barra of the waves

to pick me up again
in beneath the big waterfall

farewell to stately mountains
of dear old donegal
and twice farewell
to errigal hill
as it towers oer ash tree and rowen
as i passed through
the glen by dunlewey lake
with waters so peaceful and calm
with an ache in my heart
i was forced to depart
from gleanntáin ghlas ghaoth dobhair
as i journeyed on
through glendowans hills
with muckish to the rear
with a heart full of pain i felt no shame
twas there that i shed bitter tears
i was bound for the shores of america
far across the wild raging foam
i bade farewell
for a spell to donegal
and gleanntáin ghlas ghaoth dobhair
twas never my play to travel afar
from my own beloved land
but the intrigue and the guile
of the tyrants hand forced me to leave my home
twas the wish of my heart to return again
if i could get money in store
and my days there to end
among the relations and friends
around the gleanntáin ghlas ghaoth dobhair
farewell farewell to donegal
that county sweet and fair
and to her brave men when the enemy came
never cowered or bowed to the gall
i hold in esteem all those women and men
and all children big and small
that dwell there in peace without worry or grief
in gleanntáin ghlas ghaoth dobhair

i dont know you
but i want you
all the more for that
words fall through me
and always fool me
and i cant react
and games that never amount
to more than theyre meant
will play themselves out
take this sinking boat and point it home
weve still got time
raise your hopeful voice you have a choice
youll make it now
falling slowly eyes that know me
and i cant go back
moods that take me and erase me
and im painted black
you have suffered enough
and warred with yourself
its time that you won
take this sinking boat and point it home
weve still got time
raise your hopeful voice you have a choice
youve made it now
falling slowly sing your melody
ill sing it loud
i paid the cost too late
now youre gone
*
youll be a scientist youll ask the question
youll be like a boxer with blood on your vest
youll be like the tiger youll be like the lion
youll leave the enemy sitting on his butt
youll put your hand up youll beat the clock
youll hit the punchbag hard or soft
youll be a winner dont wait for luck
do your best and youll see yourself
standing on the top of the mountain
everyone else on the sidelines
yell it out in gods name
everyone else on the sidelines
and youll be standing on the top of the mountain
survive through the cold survive through the heat
youll go to hell and youll come back
youll be like the fianna heroes of old
youll reach the end and youll run some more
do it for your friends do it for your kids
you wont know about it if youre not there
look to the future listen to the music
leave yesterday to yesterday
youll be like the champion 
be loyal be positive be bright  have love
be strong be wild be polite be noble
be unfailing  be loyal be positive
be bright have love be strong be wild
be polite be noble

hello you there
im thinking after the years
would you like to meet
to go back on everything
they say that time would heal my pain
but i am still suffering
hello you hear me
i am always looking back
on they way things were with us
and we so young and free
do you remember the joy before
the world fell all around us
were now so different from each other
such is life
hello to you coming across
from loves tarnished excile
wanting to put right what happened
dont ever say that our love is over
hello from the other side
dont be cold as theres no need
i admit my fault
i was to blame
cant we start from the beginning tonight again
please
hello how are you
everything kept inside too long
its so difficult
time to move on
let go of what happened dont look back
and leave it completely behind us
it is no secret that
neither of us is in the land of the young

one night i was outside st bridgids day
looking down on mullaghmore
and the thing happened to me that i gave love to her
because she was lovely friendly beautiful young
it was certainly she who drove me out of my wits
and the doctor of the fianna would not cure me
and my heart is in a thousand pieces
if i dont get to lie down with her bright bosom
lovely brownhaired girl who went into danger
come over here and give me a kiss
and if my whole family were angry with me
i wouldnt give a damn my darling sweetheart
my darling sweetheart everyone is saying to me
that i will die for love of you
and there isnt a market day that would be in the gearalts
and i wouldnt get solace and me drinking
its along time now since i gave love to you
and me a small young lad without any sense
and with you i would walk hills and valleys
and to ballytemple if it was in front of us
but now i am finished tormented
and i gave the better part of my secret to the wind
oh king in paradise make ready for me
in the lovely glens with you
*
king of the universe that were not in iorras
or over in inis dhún rámha
on the banks of the finn close by the waves
watching big ships go sailing the ocean
though weary and tired with no one to cheer us
but the leafy branches to shade us
and people would fondly compare our going
to the elopment of diarmad and gráinne
last night she appeared to me in my dreaming
like i held her in the fold of my arm
this maiden so comely like a blanket of snow
if it were to refrain from thawing
pride of mankind were she by my side
as bedpal without any dowry
her honeysweet lips would sure my affliction
and ensure my sick bodys recovery
if i were a baron i wouldnt be craving
for horses or kine as a dowry
if i had this maiden to sit down beside me
or stand there so stately and cheery
the sheen in her skin is far more endearing
than the rays of the sun at the dawning
its no lie to relate but the truth here i state
that she is the fairest of maidens
*
in inis oírr in inis oírr
i didnt know about fear
nor of the sorrow
that would stop laughter
until that gloomy day
when my love sailed from me
a cloud came over the sun
and it was dark after that
why did you leave
before the primrose peeped out
through the grass bleached
by the bitter salty wind
here by the fire
wed have had our hearts desire
wasnt it this gentle tranquillity
that was best for us
some day thats meant to be
youll come back my darling
your currach speeding
against the tide
with your own peoples consent
on the crags of inis meáin
to cure my melancholy
if that can be done
inis oírr in inis oírr
oh ill wait for you there
spinning dreams
by day and night
until you have gold
and your travelling is done
you will take me into your heart
and that will lift the sadness from me
*
its a pity i am not in ireland
where i was raised where my life began
or at the foot of fair head
or by the erne close by
thats where id find the young folk
where id be sad and tired no more
and if i were but a year younger
id be off with them again
tis a full year now
since i lived in barnhill
as my big house was being built
by masons down in cork
but now my head will be atop a pike
exposed to the big wind and the rain
i swear ii i had relations with comely máire
upon my innocent soul may i be sent to the next life
id buy a garden
if i could
id plant fine tall mustard in it
topped with white blossoms
id plant oat seeds and barley seeds
seeds from which you could make beer
twas that barley and the cards
that had me wearing my bag on my back
as the moon rises
or as the the sun sets
and as the tide heads
into these western ports
id prefer to sleep with fever
than in the painful throes of death
with my body in shackles
and they crushing into my skin
dearest beloved brother
bring my suitcase home with you to them all
with my socks and my shoes
and my black coloured cloaks
bring the story back to my mother dear
who is despairing now at home
that the heavy hangmans rope
will take the place of my tie
*
in your life in the beginning in the end
in your life in the beginning in the end
isobella o isobella o
in your day while you were so peaceful
in your day while you were so true
love now forever and ever
in your life in the beginning in the end
in your life in the beginning in the end
isobella o isobella o
in your day while you were without trouble
in your day while you were without sorrow
love now forever
love now forever and ever

breeches to the knee had paddy orafferty
a hat with no base wore paddy orafferty
long yellow legs had paddy orafferty
yet my true love ran away with paddy orafferty
rise up now paddy orafferty
alas im not able to the backs of my knees being weak
im of age but no more than three feet in height
even so i had the seduction of women in me
a girl from the big house i will never accept
shes often loudmouthed sulky cantankerous
she hits out at everything the cat and the dog
in the middle of the night she has the watchword
a girl from the mountain ill get myself yet
she will milk the cow and fetter the horse for me
shell make the cake my butter and milk for me
and shell never elope with paddy orafferty

a year ago my hearts love left me
for faraway places
hell never return
until he sees the wide world around
when ill see my love coming
ill give him all my love
and smother him with honey kisses
oh jimmy my darling
my father and mother
they never can give me ease
im tired and fed up
and tormented with this life
i gave my love to the fairest
without asking i kissed him
and he went off to sea
oh jimmy my darling
ill go to the woods
and spend there all of my time
with no one around
listening to birdsong
beaneath the rowan tree
with flowers aplenty there
giving love to the most heavenly
to jimmy my darling
*
a year ago
my hearts love left me
and he wont return
until hes seen the world
when i see him how
ill rush into his arms
and smother him with honeykisses
jimmy my darling sweet

im totally fed up
and tormented by this life
i gave my love to the fairest
the handsomest one
and he boarded a ship

til he travels the globe all oer
and when he returns with laurels
ill crown him all oer

for years and years
liza was her name
but suddenly she came to me
with news that broke my heart
liza

and im not proud of my address
in a tornup town no postcode envy

but everybodys like cristal maybach
diamonds on your timepiece
jet planes islands tigers on a gold leash
we dont care
we arent caught up in your love affair
and well never be royals royals

i spent seven weeks
in the town of boyle
lying on my bed
but awake and not asleep
i was expecting every halfhour
that you would bring the priest secretly with you
but you were deceiving me
and í have lost my reputation because of you
and isnt it fine for the cabin
that my love goes to drink in
isnt it fine for the path
that he lays his shoe upon
isnt it fine for the nice young girl
that will get him in marriage
he is the guiding star of the morning
and the light of the evening
may it not be long until
i get a letter with news from you
may it not be long until
i get to open and read it
may it not be long until
i see the priest in his surplice
and we with yellow gold
in our pockets and we married to each other

oh maire bruinneal flower of the finn
i followed you here and there
your mouth was sweeter to me
than the cuckoos singing
and its you that has left me at deaths door
i am so grieved
i couldnt keep her
they said i was one
who deceives women
you have killed me forever
you have greatly weakened me
and all thats alive to me
you broke my heart
her golden trident with her down a foot
and them being piled on each side
you have killed me forever
you have greatly weakened me
and all thats alive to me
you broke my heart
one day i was musically in the road
i met the quiet young woman
you have killed me forever
you have greatly weakened me
and all thats alive to me
you broke my heart
oh maire bruinneal flower of the finn
i followed you here and there
your mouth was sweeter to me
than the cuckoos singing
and its you that has left me at deaths door

one beautiful day without worry
as i climbed up the slopes of croch shlí
neath the clouds on the skyline before me
this fair maiden i did see pass by
she reflected a radiance of beauty
that enchanted the glen on both sides
my senses she shattered completely
alas her charms overpowered my mind
my help around home is decreasing
no horses no sheep and no kind
theres no loving of kine by loch bearra
to give me the pleasures i mind
since this beautiful maiden departed
taht i fancied but wont stay with me
my best efforts could not entice her
and her wisdom has grieved my heart sore

i lost bold people

did you play a trick on me trick on me
or maybe you even put

standing on me standing on me
quench the lights now
and ill take your hand
well go dancing
and well chill
will you have the time

going far too fast
too fast because
because you came
for my whole life long
i wouldnt be able
to stop at all you are my world
i will never be able to change
because you came

this is my curse on the women
it is they who have tormented me
i fell in love early in my life
with a beautiful young woman
and she enticed me with her voice
she was gentle friendly without pride
she was most beguiling with the sweetest kiss
she was lively funny and proper
and it is no lie when i say
that she enticed me with her voice
there is nobody in my family
that did not get fun and sport out of life
alas i am left here alone
at daybreak all by myself
oh she enticed me with her voice
and many a cold long night
i spent courting her down by the pier
and coming home again without sorrow
at the dawning of the day
when she enticed me with her voice
she sailed far far away
and left me in tears
i wouldnt have cared had i not been waiting
to see her ever again
oh she enticed me with her voice
isnt it difficult for me to go through life
since that girl slipped away who broke my heart
and she left me grieving
oh my sorrow and my undoing
oh she enticed me with her voice
if i could have one wish in this world
it would surely be for us to be young forever
and i would put the hands of the clock back
to the time when life was worth living
when she enticed me with her voice
she enticed me with her voice
and she enticed me with her voice
oh she enticed me with her voice

leading the cowwithcalf to the sheiling
and i shall not see my darling lads

for a weddingsuit for my beloved
theres a new one in the tailors shop
and she is coming home today or tomorrow
my beloved does not want it

at midnight i go to the cliffs
searching for my lost one
sitting by the rocks and pleading
for her to return home to me
oh my brownhaired girl
bright love of my heart
come back soon
and be with me again
its a long time since she left
with my child and my wealth
it is a pity i hid my love from her
the one who is far from me
now im getting on in years
sitting alone by the hearth
thinking of the days that i spent
with my brownhaired girl
oh my brownhaired girl
bright love of my heart
come back soon
and be with me

my dashing darling is my hero
my dashing darling is my caesar
i have had neither sleep nor good fortune
since my dashing darling went far away
i am perpetually worried every day
wailing heavily and shedding tears
since my lively boy was released from me
and there is no word of him alas
the pleasure of the cheerful cuckoo at noon is gone
the affable nobility are not bothered with sport
the learned and the cultured are worried and sad
since the lively lad was taken from me
he is like young aonghus
like lughaidh mac chéin of the great blows
like cú raoi great son of dáire of the gold
leader of éire strong in pursuit
like conall cearnach who breached defences
like worthy fair haired feargas mac róigh
like conchubhar venerable son of nás of the tradition
the pleasant chieftain of the musical fenian branch
since my dashing darling went far away

once i was gentle maiden
but now im a spent wornout widow
my consort strongly plowing the waves
over the hills and far away
hes my champion my gallant darling
hes my caesar a gallant darling
ive found neither rest nor fortune
since my gallant darling went far away
every day im constantly enduring grief
weeping bitterly and shedding tears
because my lively lad has left me
and no news is told of him  alas
the cuckoo doesnt sing cheerfully after noon
and the sound of hounds
isnt heard in the nuttree woods
nor a summer morning in a misty glen
since my my lively boy went away from me
gallant darling for a while under sorrow
and ireland completely under black cloaks
i have found neither rest nor fortune
since my gallant darling went far away

i have cattle on the hill
with no one there to tend them
and for them i am kantany worried
between myself and god
to them i take the trail
for they have taken my senses from me
shes moll dubh of the valley
shes moll dubh of spring
shes moll dubh more ruddy than the red rose
and if i had to choose
from the young maids of the world
moll dubh a ghleanna would be my fancy
me without a wife
i wont be all my life
and moll dubh in youth just blooming
lifeless the song of the bird
that sings alone
on a mound by the edge of the moorland
the dark molly of the glen
has my heart in her keeping
she never had reproach or shame
so mannerly and honestly
she said to me this morning
depart from me and do not come again
theres not a handsome youth
from dublin down to galway
and around by umhail uí mháinnle
thats not heading for the glen
on steeds so sleek and slim
hoping to win the dark maids affection

and four speckled cows ill own

if i were in the last throes of death
and people could see no recovery
id never dictate my last will
til the arrival of fair molly nee chullinan

and i met a charming young maiden
shed make a corpse come alive
and a lovely young man of an old fellow
i long for her above and below me

my blessing on the lads
who left over the sea
but they left us nice clothes to wear
to go out on a sunday
a coat that stretched to the ground
and a blouse of strong silk
trousers that were in fashion
and shoes of spanish leather
oh the lads
the lads were beautiful
oh the lads
the lads were beautiful
when i saw the rough sea
oh my heart was broken
thinking about the lads
as they are in the boats
but i pray to the king of the angels
that the planets settle down
that they bring home the lads
who are in danger of being drowned
i got a letter from scotland
it did not satify me
that the lads had married
the girls of that place
its not that we wouldnt like them
if they satisfied us
but the girls of the island
theyre the ones we prefer

god save their souls and mind them well
tomas and sean conneeley
yesterday at half past four
they pushed their currach from the shore
one took the net while one took the oar
the two fishermen conneeley
from connors fort and from synges chair
towards inis mor and inis iarr
they scour the sea in silent prayer
as they go searching for their neighbours

goodbye goodbye

your protection and your friendship
were always desired
and the great love of my heart
stories and songs
old as the mountains
strong and brave with age
goodbye to the days
that were turning so lightheartedly
goodbye to the days that were
goodbye to the night
turning on the first hour
goodbye to the days that were
at the sight of the sea
and the sun on the seashore
and the great love of my heart
were stories and balar
in three mici gorra
ancient islands like a dream
i had a sweetheart from summer up to winter
my dearest love

nancy my love beautiful woman without blemish
may luck and fortune accompany you
your hands are whiter than the foam on the beach
or than the swan that swims on the eire river
your eyes are more beautiful than a dewdrop
and your voice sounds prettier than harpstrings
and if you dont run away with me my life will cloud over
and because of you they will bury me
i hear the voices of many women everywhere
here there and on the other side of the erne river
even cock with its ports and the city ballinasloe
nancy is the most beautiful of all of them
oh mary and my god wouldnt we live well
if we could both be together
on a nice peaceful afternoon my beloved and i
whispering things to us on the deserted plateau
carry my letter to kind nancy of the braids
and tell her how saddened i am
tell her that i dont sleep at night
that a sharp pain punctures my side
tell it to her eyes tell it to her hair
tell it to her good and sensible mood
tell it to her head and also to her sweet mouth
tell her that she has managed to shorten my life

going back to the corner
where i first saw you
gonna camp in my sleeping bag
im not gonna move
got some words on cardboard
got your picture in my hand
saying if you see this girl
can you tell her where i am 
some try to hand me money
they dont understand
im not broke im just
a broken hearted man
i know it makes no sense
but what else can i do
how can i move on when
im still in love with you
cause if one day you wake up
and find that youre missing me
and your heart starts to wonder
where on this earth i could be
thinkin maybe youll come back here
to the place that wed meet
and youll see me waiting for you
on the corner of the street
so im not moving
im not moving
policeman says
son you cant stay here
i said theres someone im waiting for if
its a day a month a year
gotta stand my ground
even if it rains or snows
if she changes her mind
this is the first place she will go
people talk about the guy
thats waiting on a girl
there are no holes in his shoes
but a big hole in his world
maybe ill get famous as the man
who cant be moved
maybe you wont mean to
but youll see me on the news
and youll come running to the corner
cause youll know its just for you

i went into a public house last night
and i asked the barwoman for credit
she said to me you wont get a drop

it is not yet the day nor the day
its not yet day and it wont be til morning

and i asked for the change of a shilling
she said to me sit down at the table
and drink here until the morning

til you keep music with the good person
wholl be drinking here until morning
rise up man of the house

somewhere in moments you look to the past
searching through pages of time
and you step back deciding
whats foolish whats wise
seems so clear in your mind
never doubting this love from the start
i hear you whispering
i hear your advice
thought that i knew it all no easy way
i hear you whispering
i hear your advice
how can we know what the book of life holds
for us all
pathways are taken
some easy some hard
seems to matter less now
as you cherish whats dear to your heart
*
the time we have now is running out
you are tormenting me mmm mmm
and now is the time for youth to blossom
this is the day mmm mmmm
walking on tiptoes
hoping youll come
with help from your brothers
well turn this wheel around
those who surround me are telling lies
theyre tormenting me mm mmm
we came with fun fun fun
sing it out loud loud loud
like the fire radiance in our life
the way will be lit for us we wont be in danger
look at our beauty its growing
the likes of this will never be seen again
enchanted we fly splended free
lets rise with pride shining down from the sun
come along with us thats what hed do
the likes of this will never be seen again
like the fire uh
people laugh at you in jealousy
drowned in cries mmm mmmm
and take your time stay till were ready
our own game mmm mmm
who cares about everyone else
were not the same
together in the night forevermore eternally
we dont have to worry
about those little things

i went to the market
and traded my cow
for five pounds in money
and a gold guinea coin
if i drank all the money
and my gold i did share
since its no ones concern
then so no one should care
if i drank all the money
and my gold i did share
since its no ones concern

if i go to the green woods
wild berries to store
plucking apples from bowers
or herding the cows
if i relax in the shade
for an hour or more
since its no ones concern
then so no one should care

and events of that sort
if i see people merry
and their merriment share
since its no ones concern

people are saying
im a cad gone astray
without goods or possessions
no cow and no care
if its my own desire
to live in a craw

advice i received out on the road
from a rogue of a priest to marry an old man
but he cared for nothing save that i would increase his wealth
and that i would be for my whole life dependent on the neighbors
o yerra old man being with you is not for me
o yerra old man may you be scorched and burned
o yerra old man being with you is not for me
and if i were at the door i would catch you alive
i went to cork looking for the wherewithal for a wake
tobacco pipes and wood for a coffin
on my return home sick tired and sad
where did i find my old man but roasting bacon
if i were to find my old man drowned in a boghole
his legs broken and his bones in pain
id take him home and id wake him
and id walk out with the young boys
if you marry an old man you will marry a rogue
who will leave rags before you on the stairs
in the morning hell be complaining with roguery
and in the evening hell be merrily playing music
i married an old man i had no sense
i did that on the advice of my relatives
i went home with him sad is the story
and i got up in the morning preferring to be dead
o yerra old man being with you is not for me
o yerra old man may you be scorched and burned
o yerra old man being with you is not for me
and a couple of sundays will put you under the sod

the fine potatoes
a yellow blight is on them
and our with the hunger
it is not long that we will be alive
we are lost forever
and underneath the sod will be the people of mayo
alas alas alas
woe time of the poor life
alas alas alas
woe the great famine
a woman is up in britain
without an ear for our people
and no one sees our tears but the lady of paradise
we are sick with illness
without anything to eat
and our foodvessels and flax are gone over the sea
the people are broken
pained and scattered to the wind
and our children are discarded on the side of the road
our land is not divided
it is not long since it has been harvested
nothing but the long wild grass is growing over us

you have kept me behind all the others

murmur of the sea

on matters sacred
to the grand ocean
sound of the waves
harmonies to my desire to see you
sweet music of my yearning for you
voice from beyond
by wave edge

beyond the salty years
saying you wish
to visit my island
show me the isles

a spell draws me to the reaches
beyond my ken
welcome voice from beyond

the stone that my grandmother
and grandfather used to talk about
has returned as it left
my brave stone
and i dont care whether its in kerrera
callendar or calvay
as long as its in
steep rugged scotland
s i u ro bha ho ro hilli um bo ha
hilli um bo ruaig thu i hilli um bo ha
s i u ro bha ho ro hilli um bo ha
to be put in a place of refuge
which will conceal it safely
so that they cant they wont manage to
remove a single fragment of it
the stone that was lost to us
prised from their grasp
and certainly if it has returned
thats a very good thing
let us swear by our hand
each and every one of us
that we will allow nothing to endanger
the man who unloosed it
and dared to rescue it
from an unpleasant place
if they lay hands on him
well need to be strong
and strike a blow for him
using steel
the minister was so sorrowful
when he woke that morning
his eyes bleary
as he turned out
walking the floor
sighing and praying
and looking at the nook
where hed found the stone missing
there was much pacing
and running round the floor
and all he could say was
where did the stone go
and by the holy mother
what will i do tomorrow
i know the queen
will be beside herself
said he looking deathly pale
id never have believed
it could have been raised from the floor
by someone no bigger than a wasp
something is to happen to me
and heaven help me
the man who unloosed it
must be as strong as a horse
*

its like theres no medicine
there doesnt be any sleep
if you dont have
enough yet
stop a second and name your
price
is there a reason youre over serious
pretending like theres things on us
with the spirit you have
we can go far
because its not possible
to have fun
bridge
everybody look left
everyone look right
do you understand now
no one will be left over
we dont care about the money or profit
we do not mind being in the binge
well make the world dance
happy and entertaining
not a single thing matters
no one is taking care of you
the world will be dancing
happy and entertaining
we have to go back to
the place of dreams come true
when there was no problem
or higher aim
id love to be back
everyones hooked on it
they are all exploring opportunity
to be happy and secure
what is in the future
i promise you well be alright

the many methods of making money
leave little leisure for having fun
and think how long youll be stretched and breathless
alone and lonely beneath a stone
if youre a lord or a duke or princeling
youll take no gold when you go below
and therefore think that the greatest wisdom
is making merry with preab san ol
there are people with cattle and sheep
who go to the fair and get much reward
dágeur chun cíbe agus as sin go mínligh
wise points are clear to them
but this month it is witnessed
that they will cry and shed tears
so then nothing is wiser
than to continue forever drinking
the gombeenman in his greed for money
will take ten gains for the price of one
the cheapest goods will be priced the dearest
for what costs sixpence hell charge a crown
but as the camel can thread no needle
the gombeenman if hed save his soul
must therefore think that the greatest wisdom
is making merry with preab san ol
the ship that sails on the pathless ocean
no chart no sextant to shoot the sun
will yet in spain or in rock gibraltar
find friends to meet with when day is done
the grand seignior in his airy palace
may see bags filling and call for more
and yet death waits so the greatest wisdom
is making merry with preab san ol
the craosach merchant nil and no way attitude
to gold not seen him
the most expensive rate on the cheapest item
value an it phinge of have a crown
d talk chríosta a notmade
the gusto camel through ghró
s therefore there is a more prudent measure
never ever have to kick the drink
the lovely lily that toils nor spins not
arrayed in beauty thats like the sun
but solomon in his wit and wisdom
could not stand up to comparison
in life theres nothing but puff or bubble
an arrow loosed or another bowl
so therefore think that the greatest wisdom
is making merry with preab san ol

little rose be not sad for all that hath behapped thee
the friars are coming across the sea they march on the main
from the pope shall come thy pardon and from rome from the east
and stint not spanish wine to my little dark rose
long the journey that i made with her from yesterday till today
over mountains did i go with her under the sails upon the sea
the erne i passed by leaping though wide the flood
and there was string music on each side of me and my little dark rose
thou hast slain me o my bride and may it serve thee no whit
for the soul within me loveth thee not since yesterday nor today
thou has left me weak and broken in mien and in shape
betray me not who love thee my little dark rose
i would walk the dew with thee and the meadowy wastes
in hope of getting love from thee or part of my will
frangrant branch thou didst promise me that thou hadst for me love
and sure the flower of all munster is little dark rose
had i a yoke of horses i would plough against the hills
in middlemass id make a gospel of my little dark rose
id give a kiss to the young girl that would give her mouth to me
and behind the liss would lie embracing my little dark rose
the erne shall rise in rude torrents hills shall be rent
the sea shall roll in red waves and blood be poured out
every mountain glen in ireland and the bogs shall quake
some day ere shall perish my little dark rose

the star has reminded me over
love is a love ainn was between us

are not you know hell
we had it all
love without pain problem
but you left me without any precautions
thinking thinking it
i was lost without purpose without any direction
poor people hidden in the mist lonely

now that weve gathered join us early
she will be there soon
now that weve gathered
be with us with your hearts all together
she will be here soon
its our time its our time
we will come together with our language
from the day that we set our feet on the ground
as true as the sun over our head
our voices talking about
things youve never heard before
and much more if you come with me
many here in our country
thought people would not be able to change
but the blush light on my face
is a color that cant be divided
he is saying be successful
in the big circle wheel of life
in our change over yet
from goodness to bad
trust and love
we will go
our own way the big circle wheel
big circle wheel of life
in the big circle wheel of life
in our change so far
from goodness to bad

rudolph the rednosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose
and if you ever saw it
you would even say it glows
all of the other reindeer
used to laugh and call him names
they never let poor rudolph
play in any reindeer games
then one foggy christmas eve
santa came to say
rudolph with your nose so bright
wont you guide my sleigh tonight
then all the reindeer loved him
as they shouted out with glee
rudolph the rednosed reindeer
youll go down in history

morning and the days beginning
and i leave my home
my heart is breaking
my youth is long past
night and i am alone
endless deep black skies
remembering days that were
without want and without gloom
i listen to the wind
great loneliness forever endless
the end of the long journey
i am sad sorrowful and broken

upon my drawing west to carn tsiail
to the annual fair of the feast of stmary
the young girl coming from the west happened upon me
and she was melancholy as she passed me on the road
it seemed to me that my senses had left me
as if i were dazed or i had been drinking for a spell
it looked to me as if the bright sun had darkened
beside all the radiance that was in her rosy cheek
with a start i greeted the maiden
without no trace of sense in my voice
i inquired of her if there was a man in ireland
whom she would choose over me in her path
she asked of me where was my shirt
my wig my beaver hat not to mention my shoes
that she had rarely seen a sack as clothes
on a man whod entice young girls
theres not a place from here to min a lábáin
where i havent been in love with a woman or two
a woman in the rosses over in min a marach
from gleann ailne to mucais mh6r
a pair in baollach a pair in báineach
a woman in aran and one by gweedore
from letterkenny to ballydavid
and to coillidh mhánais along the way
i was in moneymore in caislean cabha
in baile uí dhálaigh and in lisnaskea
i have been in monahan and at the grainsi
and at droichead chúl aine for over a year
last night i happened to be in drogheda
and tonight im here around carn tsial
and now if you dont prefer me to men of affairs
heres my hand to you and ill travel on

ill dye my petticoat ill dye it red
and round the world ill beg my bread
til i find my love alive or dead
go to the door and fly with me

a hundred farewells
from this place im in
beside maigue of the berries
the branches the stacks
the estates the jewels
the craftsmen the crowds
the arts the stories
the goodhumored warriors
oh it is ill i am
without a share or right
or company or money
without happiness or jewels
or sport or vitality
since i was sent into loneliness
farewell forever
to her happy freeman
to her love of kin her gatherings
her clergy her scholars
to the friends of my heart
not perverse or deceitful
without flaw without concealment
without gluttony without stinginess
goodbye one by one
to its beautiful women
to their fame their sense
their loveliness their complexions
to all its women
to their rank their visitations
their messing their discussions
their minds and their talents

oh bright happy slieve cua
you are so far from me
i am sitting here alone
by the inlet weak with sorrow
the water flows beside me
between me and the land of my heart
oh bright happy slieve cua
i am in a terrible state
if i were among my own people
in the greenhedged place of the gentle men
when the suns heat falls
from the flawless sky
or if i were there beneath the starry night
when the dew falls on the grass
oh bright slieve cua would it not
be a great charity if i could have that
it is sad that i was not brought up
with great knowledge and learning
in noble beautiful irish
my mouth would take flight
i would plough my way across the sea
and i would bring you great gifts
for bright slieve cua
i would like to raise you above all
if i were among my own people
in the greenhedged place of the gentle men
when the suns heat falls
from the flawless sky
or if i were there beneath the starry night
when the dew falls on the grass
oh bright slieve cua would it not
be a great charity if i could have that

listen to my heart forever sad
i am lost without you and your wife
the great love in your lives will guide me
be with me always day and night
weeping due to the great loneliness
the tears sorrowfully
asleep in the quiet green grave
in a deep peace
there was happiness but that is gone
you followed your husband
the great love in your lives will guide me
be with me always day and night
weeping due to the great loneliness
the tears sorrowfully
asleep in the quiet green grave
in a deep peace
a thought on the day you were both at my side
telling a story of how things were
i remember the day
without want and without gloom
be with me always day and night

the lights shine brightly this christmastide
from heart of town to countryside
candle of christmas alight in the window
a guide for mary wherever she may go
this is the time of the star and lights in the sky
and calm of christmas with expectancy draws nigh
the rich person and the poor person united as one
await the arrival of jesus in this world undone
until the brightness of lights the road is before
jesus you will be our sure guide forever more
a light of moving brightness other lights but still
your approach jesus coming to that holy hill
o jesus come to mary and bless our world anew
stay with us this night that we may come to know you
erase from our lives the ugliness and the hatred
purify the love in our hearts which is oh so tainted

i look hard at the fire that was strongest
building itself under my breath
pulling your people together with joy
wings shaking for the flight that lies before you
released to the lover who is sick
i wonder will i be alone in the night
its difficult for anyone to welcome
so much jealousy and dissention about it
with her smile so bright and her tongue so sweet
shes the light of the mountains and my fine love
and the fruitful land full of heady memories
shes the light of the mountains and my fine love
spent in the silence and taken by the chance
to put my heart before her unassumingly
the freshness of the sky blessing us in the field
arent we really lucky that we met again
my mind gone off wandering and i on its tail
wonder of wonders i survived nonetheless
the truth of familys words are recorded
the heat from my mouth telling me to move on
*
some nights i stay up cashing in my bad luck
some nights i call it a draw
some nights i wish that my lips could build a castle
some nights i wish theyd just fall off
but i still wake up i still see your ghost
oh lord im still not sure what i stand for oh
what do i stand for what do i stand for
most nights i dont know anymore
this is it boys this is war 
what are we waiting for
why dont we break the rules already
i was never one to believe the hype
save that for the black and white
i try twice as hard and im half as liked
but here they come again to jack my style
thats alright
i found a martyr in my bed tonight
she stops my bones from wondering
just who i am who i am who i am
oh who am i mmm mmm
well some nights i wish that this all would end
cause i could use some friends for a change
and some nights im scared youll forget me again
some nights i always win i always win
but i still wake up i still see your ghost
oh lord im still not sure what i stand for oh
what do i stand for what do i stand for
most nights i dont know oh come on
so this is it
i sold my soul for this
washed my hands of that for this
i miss my mom and dad for this
no when i see stars when i see
when i see stars thats all they are
when i hear songs they sound like this one
so come on oh come on
oh come on oh come on
well that is it guys that is all 
five minutes in and im bored again
ten years of this im not sure
if anybody understands
this one is not for the folks at home
sorry to leave mom i had to go
who the fuck wants to die alone
all dried up in the desert sun
my heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she call love
when i look into my nephews eyes
man you wouldnt believe the most amazing things that can come from
some terrible nights ah
the other night you wouldnt believe
the dream i just had about you and me
i called you up but wed both agree
its for the best you didnt listen
its for the best we get our distance oh
its for the best you didnt listen
its for the best we get our distance oh

never again will i go to cashel
selling and trading my health
nor to the hiringfair sitting by the wall
a lounger on the roadside
the bucks of the country coming on their horses
asking if im hired
oh lets go the journey is long
off goes the spailpín fánach
i was left as a spailpín fánach
depending on my health
walking the dew early in the morning
catching all the illnesses going around
youll not see a hook in my hand for harvesting
a flail or a short spade
but the flag of france over my bed
and the pike for stabbing
five hundred farewells to the land of my father
and to the dear island
and to the boys of cualach because they never
feared in the troubled times on defense
but now that i am poor miserable and alone
in these foreign lands
im heartbroken because i got the call
to be a spailpín fánach
i well remember my people were at one time
over at the bridge at gáil
with cattle with sheep with little white calves
and plenty of horses
but it was the will of god that we were evicted
and we were left with only our health
and what broke my heart everywhere i went
call here you spailpín fánach

and green grass from the heavens stems
cows udders are near rending
from the overflow of milk in them
by the bottom of the garden oh mary

the shortcut by the praties
well hasten to the fiddler
at one time in my life
i was dearly loved by everyone
havent times changed a lot
when no one cares a whit for me

til you wake in the morning

your blue eyes autumn water
skin chalk winter snow
coma desire summer barley
grief póige spring flowers
your blue eyes autumn water
pure white skin like winter snow
your fair hair summer barley
scented kisses spring flowers
on the edge of the sea
we moved together
and we lifted our voices
high into the sky
morning fog wind gust
soul freed stream s tide
full moon spear the night
loinnear star smile
your smile shines through the morning mist
lifts the soul light as a feather
and the moon glows in the darkest night
distant stars are yours forever
on the edge of the sea
we moved together
and we lifted our voices
high into the sky
your blue eyes autumn water
skin chalk winter snow
coma desire summer barley
grief póige spring flowers

i have not slept
since the moon lit the heavens last night
just setting the fire
and stroking the ember to light
the households retired
and i am left here to sigh
the roosters are crowing
all the world is asleep barring i
my soul is enthralled with your mouth
your face and your brow
for your sparkling blue eyes
i abandoned contentment and glee
due to longing for you
im unable to travel the way
oh friend of my bosom
the hills come between me and you
wise men proclaim that
lovesickness cna leave one unwell
i did not believe it
until my poor heart came under its spell
a malaise in my craze
i failed to ignore
with a hundred and more aching pangs
its pierced my heart to the core
i met a banshee
by the fairyrath near ballina
i asked her politely
if one could be cured of this grá
and she answered me kindly
in tones so simple and low
once it sets in the heart
it cannot be freed evermore
*
a match was amaking here last night
and it isnt with the girl that i love the best
ill leave her behind and ill go along with you
down by the banks of the ocean
a match was amaking here last night

sleeping to milking time is my delight
a bed of green rushes underneath my side
a bottle of brandy underneath my head
and a charming young maid in my arms
sleeping to milking time is my delight
a bed of green rushes underneath my side
a bottle of brandy underneath my head
and a charming young maid in my arms
oh i walked east and i walked west
i walked cork and dublins streets
an equal to my love i didnt meet
shes the wee lass thats left my heart broken

the papers have been signed
and the soldiers are going over
the drummers are happy and lighthearted
the irish are going to the land of the ships
if i had them
id give you two thousand one hundred cows
if youd be with me
in county mayo
lying in my bed
my sighs do be great
and when i get up in the morning
my tears are my prayers
the hair on my head is falling out
and disappearing like fog
and with the help of god
i wont be alive much longer
when i get up and about im lonely
and i look out on the hill over yonder
i remember your curly locks
that have left me cut to the core
my heart is a slab of black coal inside
and noone has pity for me except the king of grace
and whatever girl i would give you
i would also put her in the coffin
my stockings are all torn
and my pockets are without a penny
my wedding dress
alas is still without a stitch
i have debts at the pub
but i have never drunk a drop
but it is my greatest sorrow my love
that you and i wouldnt be young for a while again
isnt it lovely for the little birds
rising high up
celebrating together
on one small branch
but its not so for me
and my true love
for as long as each day continues
to keep us apart from each other
*
i am sitting up
since the moon arose last night
putting down a fire again
and again and keeping it lit
the family is in bed
and here am i by myself
the cocks are crowing
and the country is asleep but me
i love your mouth
your eyebrows and your cheeks
your bright blue eyes
for which i stopped hunting the wily fox
in longing for you i cannot see
to walk the road
friend of my bosom
the mountains lie between me and you
i met a fairy woman
at the rath of beal an atha
i asked her would any key
unlock the love in my heart
and she said
in soft simple language
when love enters the heart
it will never be driven from it
*
so here we go heroes or ghosts
one mans mood can break another mans soul
or am i just too
cynical for my own good
too scared to say well get there if we should
and you know yeah you know
its harder than it looks
yeah its harder than it looks
but i know
its gonna take a lot of time
and a little bit of luck
and its beginning to happen
its beginning to move
ive seen a reaction
yeah ive watched us improve
and you could say we dont care
or that we dont believe
but this is what weve got
and theres nowhere wed rather be
and you know these roads
they could take us to the start
from the shadows
youre cast to play the part
so dont grow old
forgetting who you are
a simple goal could get you very far
and you know yeah you know
its harder than it looks
yeah its harder than it looks
but i know
its gonna take a lot of time
and a little bit of luck
so here we go heroes or ghosts
one mans mood can break another mans soul
or am i just too

wind high and cold low sun
short its running sea runs strongly
cold grabs hold on the birds wing
an icy time this was told to me
*
tell me how to praise you
although i am no master of poetry
angelic face without stain
you gave me breast milk to save me
i throw myself on your protection
loving mother of the one son
under your shield protect my body
my heart my will and strength
temple of three persons
father son and holy ghost
i pray to you to aid me in
my hour of judgement and death
queen who was given by the king
the father thanks forever
motherhood and virginity
i beseech your part in my salvation
vessel who carries the light
great brightness that outshines the sun
pull me under your protection
from the short journey of life
mary gracious and beautiful
gentle mild and stately
i dont tire calling to you
you defend me on the dangerous day

raise up your hunting spear
with which we injured the white deer
raise up your hunting spear
when we were at war
we did not fast on our journey
raise up your hunting spear
sail the round hulls of your ships
to the barren lands of lochlainn
with our great lances
we killed slow raighne
raise up your hunting spear
when we were at war
we did not fast on our journey
raise up your hunting spear
sail the round hulls of your ships
to the barren lands of lochlainn
raise up your hunting spear
with which we injured the white deer
raise up your hunting spear
when we were at war

down by the beach in the deep of night
the big world is sleeping and i am alone
the seabirds are calling sorrowfully
like poor souls in pain
total purity and total abundance
bliss and calmness and beauty in the world
the murmur of the sea going into my ears
the soft song of the water flowing in the river
above on the headland there is a blessed old cemetery
the place in which saints lived in times long ago
there are people within spending a while carefree
they will not walk around on the shore anymore
loneliness strikes my spirit as i look at the cemetery
and im thinking about the people in there sleeping
men and young women old people and children
people of my people and friends of my heart
the cocks are crowing and the stars are fading
the moon is setting and its not long until day
goodbye now blessed old cemetery
and to the people who walked with me down by the beach
*
travelling down by the coast
the stars shimmering in the sky
looking back at my days of youth
and the place in which i spent my life
theres a beautiful cliff on this side
that was hit and broken by the waves
the people that are odd and cruel
polluting this world every night
i saw her like a great ship
i felt in me strain and its sad
if this place is destroyed again in front of my people
itll be the day when i am in this life
*
so keep on growing dont fail
dont retreat add to it add to yourself
leave your mark on life hands on
place your print put a root
under the earth and suck up your fill
your lunch your meal your life your meal
your life your blessed meal
what you desere what you need
for the life ahead of you in the time to come
say your prayer and bring it on
bring it on bring it on bring it on
walk your road write your story
spread out your wings and open your mouth
keep that fire lit
cut the wood collect the turf
blow on the embers clean the fireplace
dont let her go out again
dont put her out
keep that fire lit
cut the wood collect the turf
blow on the embers clean the fireplace
dont let her go out again
dont put her out dont put her out
keep her lit keep her burning
open what closed awaken from your slumber
fix what broke and light what went out
dont fail dont fall dont slip
dont wreck dont turn too far from your path
dont injure your own
your bodys health is your responsibility
from head to toe mornings and nights
you choose the kind of company your thoughts keep
spell your name and say it
say it say it say it
say it as you see it say as you feel
do what you want do what you want
but be sure that its what you want to do
do what you want do what you want
and be sure that its what you want to do
there will be time for everything between waking and sleeping
time to drink and to eat to work and to play
time to feast fast for silence and noise
love and laughter shame and honor
time to make mistakes time to correct them
time to seek and time to be on the sideline
time to break time to fix time to grow time to wither
time to die and enliven and time to set sail
time to stand your ground and time to serve
time to help and protect time to heat time for magic
do the work at hand do it
do it do do it now until its done
life changes you change and
it doesnt matter what you thought before
life changes you change in yourself
regardless of what you thought beforehand

summer will come
grass will grow
green leaves will sprout
on the treetops
my true love will come
at the break of day
and strike up a tune
out of lonliness for me
i called last night
at the house yonder
i called again
to see if my true love was there
her father said
she wasnt around
that she eloped last night
with the brownhaired boy
a curse on the sea
because its so vast
it goes between me
and the one that i love
ill walk these towns
and tramp the road
and no woman will i marry
til i lie in my grave
summer will come
grass will grow
green leaves will sprout
on the treetops
my true love will come
at the break of day
and strike up a tune
out of lonliness for me
*
summer will come
and the grass will spring
and the trees will bring forth
their foliage green
my true love will come
at the dawn of the day
and in sorrow ill play
for her a mournful lay
from an early age
i like sport and fun
and id join my true love
as the chance would come
theres no harbor town now
that id be in
but id find a fair maid
to walk hand in hand
bad cess to the ocean
but its broad and wide
it separates me from
my joy and pride
it leaves me here now
to grieve and mourn
without hope of seeing
her forever more
i called last night
to her parents door
and i called again
on my love once more
her father told me
she was not there
she eloped with the boy
with the rusty hair
*
the summer will come and grass will grow
and leaves will come on the trees
my love will return with the break of day
with a song of love for me
from my early youth i was fond of fun
and the company of my darling girl
in every port that i did dwell
i received a sweet kiss from my love
last night i called to her door
i called once more to see my love
her father told me she wasnt there
that she had eloped with the fairhaired boy
the summer will come and grass will grow
and leaves will come on the trees
my love will return with the break of day
with a song of love for me
*
southwest towards the sea
amongst the yellow flowers and rocks
i long to be back in connemara
that nice little place where we fell in love
the first place you took my hand
we will walk on the beach
with a full moon tonight
swinging swinging with their boyfriends
kissing kissing with their girlfriends
heyeyey take me out
swinging swinging with their boyfriends
kissing kissing with their girlfriends
heyeyey take me out
we were dancing throughout the night
i looked at you and my heart jumped
the best summer ever
with you in connemara
swinging swinging with their boyfriends
kissing kissing with their girlfriends
heyeyey take me out
swinging together for the day
swinging with you because you are hot
heyeyey take me out
*
i was trapped in a place that is ruled by the traffic
i was trapped in a place where you would believe in it
i was trapped in a place that is filled with the traffic
dont know how but i was always going to escape
i am going to go to where the roads have no pavements
i am traveling back and forth on the breast of the world
i am arriving to the heritage within which i was reared
dont know how but for sure ill get there
so goodbye goodbye goodbye
ill see you soon
so goodbye goodbye goodbye
ill see you soon
i am liberating the wings that are idle in my mind
i am looking for the sight that carries the light
i am looking for rest and peace for my head and heart
it matters not how but that i get there
take it easy steady on there now
take it easy dont fight yourself
take it easy steady on there now
take it easy dig deep within
take it easy steady on there now
take it easy dont fight yourself
take it easy steady on there now
take it easy itll come when it comes
i am looking for a place where the sea meets the sky
i am looking for the well of fire from which our lives are lit
i want to nurture growth of expansion in this life
and encourage reasons for celebration around me
take it easy steady on there now
take it easy dont fight yourself
take it easy steady on there now
take it easy dig deep within
take it easy steady on there now
take it easy itll come when it comes
take it easy steady on there now
take it easy let the light into your life
take it easy steady on there now

as i was leaving connemara
the fog lay on the mountains to the north
the could that was on my heart
has not lifted since
the joys of the world attracted me
to travel far and wide
but the waves of connemara
left a wake between you and me
i meant my love to return to you
although it was not to be
because the wind filled the sails
and took me far away
the ship was faithful to the sea
and smoothly sailed away
while the waves of connemara
left a wake between you and me
if you go down to the rocky shore
to cladhnach village beyond the sea
to draw water from the well
close by the seashore
you will look south im sure
at the ships so far away
while the waves of connemara
roll between you and me
if you hear a call from over the sea
at daytime or at night
on a white horse i will be
there to take you away
if you run away with me
to the beautiful noble isle
and the waves of connemara
will celebrate our love
*
over the waves going west going west
goodbye to loneliness and to the distant remoteness
bright is my heart and bright is the sun
happy to be returning to ireland
i saw my fill of countries abroad
gold and silver the wealth of the world
my heart rises in me with the break of each day
as i draw closer to the land of my people
people of the west theyre the friends of my heart
welcome and celebration awaits me on every side
leaving this life i pray to the lord
that its with them ill be stretched in the graveyard
extra verse
on my journey  oh my heart rises
the weather is beautiful and the waves are settled
steering directly to land of my bosom
and ill be in ireland tomorrow
*
down in the middle of the glen
late yesterday evening
and there were white drops of dew
lying on top of the grass
i met a maiden who had
the prettiest face and personality
she made my good sense go astray
late yesterday evening
and god how pleasant our behaviour was
going down the glen last night
stealing through the cottongrass
and there was silence in the sky
love of my heart wasnt our
heartplaying sweet and short
oh king of the bright glory
bring back last night
if i got permission to return
and to speak to the love of my heart
or if i got the better of destiny
what would i care about life
id walk with you through cottongrass
and through dunes by the edge of the sea
and gods land id lose
if i could kiss your mouth
and god how pleasant our behaviour was
going down the glen last night
stealing through the cottongrass
and there was silence in the sky
love of my heart wasnt our
heartplaying sweet and short
oh king of the bright glory
bring back last night
*
give me your love
true son of god
give me your strength
the clear bright sun
*
im tired to my heart of marriage
and of the young men of this world
theyd be better off with a nice girl
than a woman who had money
to stay awake the whole long night
wouldnt it be fine to be sporting with her
instead of the old woman who snores
and pulls the blanket to her
when i go to a wakehouse or funeral
all the young women ask me
cormac are you getting married
or do you see that youth is wearing away
i said to them and i still say
that i do indeed see it alas
and those who arent married
have all the fun in life
i will go complaining and chattering
to __ far in the west
ill take a trip to aran
to the young woman who has tormented my heart
by the book if my marriage has been made
its not that my heart has been bound
and ill go off to rome
to get permission to marry again
*
by creggan graveyard
i slept last night in sorrow
at daybreak
i was kissed by a young woman
with flaming cheeks
and a golden luster in her hair
one look of her
would cure all the worlds ills
my kind young man
do not sleep in sorrow
but rise swiftly
and come along the road with me
to the land of honey
where the foreigner has no hold
where you will find happiness
enticing me with sweet music
oh sweet princess
are you helen that transfixed the horde
or one of the nine fine women
from parnassus made in such form
which land in the world
would hold you oh star without cloud
that you want my sort
whispering with you back in the road
*
arent we ready to be careful
and its not our aim to be shy
if love isnt the purpose
it wouldnt be a wheel
it wouldnt be ever
oh at the tyrant a tear of the vulnerable person
at a rambling soul the bones that are miraculous
at every dreamer is an unstoppable
only ideas are needed
on monday i was agitated
tuesday against my faith to tear
wednesday  my mind on high returns
thursday  read over read over
love of my heart on friday
saturday burning like a fire
and sunday is not the aim of destroying ever
he is __
he wil be there
we were obsolete and finished
how did i get so blind and stupid
if love is the aim were unstoppable
we couldnt ever
*
feeling my way through the darkness
guided by a beating heart
i cant tell where the journey will end
but i know where to start
they tell me im too young to understand
they say im caught up in a dream
well life will pass me by
if i dont open up my eyes
well thats fine by me
so wake me up when its all over
when im wiser and im older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didnt know i was lost
i tried carrying the weight of the world
but i only have two hands
hope i get the chance to travel the world
but i dont have any plans
wish that i could stay forever this young
not afraid to close my eyes
lifes a game made for everyone
and love is the prize
*
